  <h2 class='c007'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>No Commentary upon Magna Carta has hitherto been
written from the standpoint of modern research. No
serious attempt has yet been made to supersede, or even
adequately to supplement, the works of Coke and Richard
Thomson, published respectively in 1642 and 1829, and
now hopelessly out of date. This lack of enterprise may
be due in part to a natural reluctance to undertake so
laborious a task, but seems also to suggest tacit acquiescence
in the opinion of Bishop Stubbs that no separate commentary
is required, since “the whole of the constitutional
history of England is little more than a commentary on
Magna Carta.” Yet, for that very reason the Great
Charter is surely worthy to be made the subject of special
and detailed study, since few documents can compete with
it in the variety and interest of its contents, in the vividness
of its historical setting, or in the influence it has exercised
on the struggle for constitutional liberty. That this conspicuous
gap in our historical and legal literature should
have remained so long unfilled is the more remarkable in
view of the great advance, amounting almost to a revolution,
which has been effected since Coke and Thomson wrote.
Within the last twenty years, in especial, a wealth of new
material has been explored with notable results. Discoveries
have been made, profoundly affecting our views of every
branch of law, every organ of government, and every aspect
of social and individual life in medieval England. Nothing,
however, has hitherto been done towards applying to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>systematic elucidation of Magna Carta the new stores of
knowledge thus accumulated.</p>

<p class='c001'>With this object in view, I have endeavoured, throughout
several years of hard, but congenial work, to collect, sift,
and arrange the mass of evidence, drawn from many
scattered sources, capable of throwing light upon John’s
Great Charter. The results have now been condensed into
the Commentary which fills two thirds of the present
volume. This attempt to explain, point by point, the
sixty-three chapters of Magna Carta, embracing, as these do,
every topic—legal, political, economic and social—in which
John and his barons felt a vital interest, has involved an
analysis in some detail of the whole public and private life
of England during the thirteenth century. The Commentary
is preceded by a Historical Introduction, which
describes the events leading to the crisis of 1215, analyzes
the grievances which stirred the barons to revolt, discusses
the contents and characteristics of the Charter, traces its
connection with the subsequent course of English history,
and gives some account of previous editions and commentaries.</p>

<p class='c001'>While reference has been made throughout to original
sources where these were available, advantage has been
freely taken of the labours of others. If a debt of gratitude
requires to be here acknowledged to previous commentators,
a far deeper debt is due to many scholars who have, within
recent years, by their labours in various fields not directly
connected with Magna Carta, incidentally thrown light on
topics of which the Charter treats. Of Bishop Stubbs it is
almost unnecessary to speak, since his works form the
common starting-point of all historians and constitutional
lawyers of the present generation. Readers versed in
modern literature will readily trace the influence of Prof.
Maitland, Mr. J. Horace Round, Sir Frederic Pollock, Mr.
L. O. Pike, and Prof. Prothero; while the numerous other
authorities laid under contribution are referred to in the
foot-notes and the appended bibliography. Frequent
reference has been made to two independent and scholarly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>histories of the reign of John which have recently appeared—Miss
Norgate’s <cite>John Lackland</cite>, and Sir James H. Ramsay’s
<cite>Angevin Empire</cite>. Of the older books dealing directly with
the subject in hand, Sir William Blackstone’s <cite>Great Charter</cite>
has been found the best; while among modern works
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Chartes</cite></span> of M. Charles Bémont is the most valuable.
The inexhaustible stores of Madox’s <cite>History of the Exchequer</cite>
have also been freely drawn upon.</p>

<p class='c001'>While these pages were passing through the press a
brilliant essay by Mr. Edward Jenks appeared in the pages
of <cite>The Independent Review</cite> for November 1904, whose title
<cite>The Myth of Magna Carta</cite> indicates the unconventional and
iconoclastic lines on which it proceeds. He argues with
much force that the Charter was the product of the selfish
action of the barons pressing their own interests, and not of
any disinterested or national movement; that it was not,
by any means, “a great landmark in history”; and that,
instead of proving a material help in England’s advance
towards constitutional freedom, it was rather “a stumbling
block in the path of progress,” being entirely feudal and
reactionary in its intention and effects. Finally, for most
of the popular misapprehensions concerning it, he holds
Sir Edward Coke responsible. How far the present writer
is in agreement with these opinions will appear from the
following pages: but Mr. Jenks’ position would seem to
require modification in at least three respects: (1) A few
of the provisions of John’s Charter are by no means of a
reactionary nature. (2) Coke cannot be credited with the
initiation of all, or even most, of the popular fallacies which
have come, in the course of centuries, to cluster so thickly
round the Charter. (3) Mr. Jenks, perhaps, undervalues
the importance of traditional interpretations which, even
when based on insecure historical foundations, are shown in
the sequel to have proved of supreme value in the battle of
freedom.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am indebted to four friends who have kindly read my
proof sheets, to Mr. W. R. J. Gray, and Mr. Robert A.
Moody, whose good offices in this direction are not now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>rendered for the first time, and to two of the members of
my Honours Class of 1903-4, Mr. A. C. Black, Jun., and
Mr. D. B. Mungo, all of whom have been zealous in help
and fertile in suggestion.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>PART I. <br /> EVENTS LEADING TO MAGNA CARTA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Great Charter is too often treated as the outcome of
purely accidental causes. Students of its origin are sometimes
content to explain it as a mere tangible product of
the successful resistance called forth by the tyrannies
of King John. That monarch’s personal misdeeds, it is
maintained, goaded into determined action a fierce unflinching
opposition which never rested until it had
achieved success; and the outcome of this success was the
winning of the Great Charter of Liberties. The moving
causes of events of such tremendous moment are thus
sought in the characteristics and vices of one man. If
John had never lived and sinned, so it would appear, the
foundations of English freedom would never have been laid.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such shallow views of history unnecessarily belittle the
magnitude and inevitable nature of the sequence of causes
and effects upon which great issues really depend. The
compelling logic of events forces a way for its own fulfilment,
independent of the caprices, aims and ambitions of
individual men. The incidents of John’s career are the
occasions, not the causes, of the great national movement
which laid the foundations of English liberties. The origin
of Magna Carta lies too deep to be determined by any
purely contingent or accidental phenomena. It is as unwise
as it is unnecessary to suppose that the course of constitutional
development in England was suddenly and violently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>wrested into a completely new channel, merely because of
the incapacity or misdeeds of the temporary occupant of
the throne. The source of the discontent fanned to flame
by John’s oppressions must be sought in earlier reigns.
The genesis of the Charter cannot be understood apart
from its historical antecedents, and these are inextricably
bound up with the whole story how England grew to be a
nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>In expounding the origin of the Charter, it is
necessary briefly to narrate how the scattered Anglo-Saxon
and Danish tribes and territories, originally unconnected,
were gradually welded together and grew into England;
how this fusion was made permanent by the growth of a
strong form of centralized monarchical government which
crushed out all attempts at local independence, and threatened
to become the most absolute despotism in Europe;
and how, finally, the Crown, because of the very plenitude
of its power, challenged opposition and called into play
forces which set limits to royal prerogatives and royal
aggressions, and at the same time laid the foundations of
the reign of law. A short survey of the early history of
England forms a necessary preliminary to a right understanding
of Magna Carta. Such a survey makes prominent
two leading movements, one of which succeeds the other;
namely, the establishment of a strong monarchy able to
bring order out of anarchy, and the subsequent establishment
of safeguards to prevent this source of order degenerating
into an unrestrained tyranny, and so crushing out not merely
anarchy but legitimate freedom as well. The later movement,
in favour of liberty and the Great Charter, was the
natural complement, and, in part, the consequence of the
earlier movement in the direction of a strong government
able to enforce peace. In historical sequence, order precedes
freedom.</p>

<p class='c001'>These two problems, each forming the counterpart of the
other, necessarily arise in the history of every nation, and in
every age; the problem of <em>order</em>, or how to found a central
government strong enough to suppress anarchy, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>problem of <em>freedom</em>, or how to set limits to an autocracy
threatening to overshadow individual liberty. Neither of
these problems can ever be ignored, not even in the
twentieth century; although to-day the accumulated
political experience of ages has enabled modern nations,
such at least as are sufficiently educated in self-government,
to thrust them into the background, out of view. Deep
political insight may still be acknowledged in Æsop’s fable
of Jupiter and the frogs. King Log proves as ineffective
against foreign invasion as he is void of offence to domestic
freedom; King Stork secures the triumph of his subjects in
time of war, but devours them in time of peace. All
nations in their early efforts to obtain an efficient government
have to choose between these two types of ruler—between
an executive, harmless but weak; and one powerful
enough effectively to direct the business of government at
home and abroad, but ready to turn the powers entrusted
to him for the good of all, to his own selfish uses and
the trampling out of his subjects’ liberties.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, the miseries of the long centuries of
Anglo-Saxon rule were mainly the outcome of the Crown’s
weakness; while, at the Norman Conquest, England escaped
from the mild sceptre of inefficiency, only to fall under the
cruel sceptre of selfish strength. Yet the able kings of the
new dynasty, powerful as they were, had to struggle in order
to maintain their supremacy; for, although the conquered
English races were incapable of concerted resistance against
their Norman masters, the unruly alien barons fought vigorously
to shake off the royal control.</p>

<p class='c001'>During a century of Norman rule, constant warfare
was waged between two great principles—the monarchic
standing on the whole for order, seeking to crush anarchy,
and the oligarchic or baronial, standing on the whole for
liberty, protesting against the tyranny of autocratic power.
Sometimes one of these was in the ascendant; sometimes the
other. The history of medieval England is the swing of the
pendulum between these two extremes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The main plot, then, of early English history, centres
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>round the attempt to found a strong monarchy, and yet to
set limits to its strength. With this main plot subordinate
plots are interwoven. Chief among these must be reckoned
the necessity of defining the relations of the central to the
local government, and the need of an acknowledged frontier
between the domains of Church and State. On the other
hand, all that interesting group of problems connected with
the <em>ideal form</em> of government, much discussed in the days of
Aristotle as in our own, is notably absent, never having been
forced by the logic of events upon the mind of medieval
Europe. Monarchy was apparently assumed as the only
possible scheme of government; while the relative merits of
aristocracy and democracy, or of the much-vaunted constitution
known as “mixed,” were not canvassed, since these
forms of constitution were not within the sphere of practical
politics.</p>

<p class='c001'>The student of history will do well to concentrate his
attention at first on the main problem, while viewing
the subsidiary ones in their relations to the central current.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>I. William I. to Henry II.—Main Problem: the Monarchy.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The attention of the most casual student is arrested by
the consideration of the difficulties which surrounded the
English nation in its early struggles for bare existence.
The great problem was, first, how to get itself into being,
and thereafter how to guard against the forces of disintegration,
which strove without rest to tear it to pieces
again. The dawn of English history shows the beginning
of that long slow process of consolidation in which unconscious
reason played a deeper part than human will,
whereby many discordant tribes and races, many independent
provinces, were crushed together into something
bearing a rude likeness to a united nation. Many forces
converged in achieving this result. The coercion of strong
tribes over their weaker neighbours, the pressure of outside
foes, the growth of a body of law, and of public opinion,
the influence of religion in the direction of peace, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>helped to weld a chaos of incongruous and warring
elements together.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is notable that each of the three influences, destined
ultimately to aid most materially in this process of
unification, threatened at one time to have a contrary
effect. Thus the rivalries of the smaller kingdoms tended
at first towards a complete disruption, before Wessex
succeeded in asserting an undisputed supremacy; the
Christianizing of England partly by Celtic missionaries
from the north and partly by emissaries from Rome
threatened to split the country into two, until their
mutual rivalries were stilled after the Synod of Whitby
in 664; and one effect of the incursion of the Danes was
to create an absolute barrier between the lands that lay on
either side of Watling Street, before the whole country
succumbed to the unifying pressure of Cnut and his sons.</p>

<p class='c001'>The stern discipline of foreign conquest was required
to make national unity possible; and, with the restoration
of the old Wessex dynasty in the person of Edward
Confessor, the forces of disintegration again made headway.
England threatened once more to fall to pieces,
but at the critical and appointed time the iron rule of
the Normans came to complete what the Danes had
begun half a century earlier. As the weakness of the
Anglo-Saxon kings and the disruption of the country had
gone hand in hand, so the process which, after the Conquest,
made England one, was identical with the process
which established the throne of the new dynasty on a
strong, enduring basis. The complete unification of England
was the result of the Norman despotism.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thereafter, the strength of its monarchy was what
rendered England unique in medieval Europe. Three
great kings in especial contributed, by their ability and
indomitable power of will, to this result—William the
Conqueror, Henry Beauclerk, and Henry Plantagenet. In
a sense, the work of all three was the same, namely, to
build up the central authority against the disintegrating
effects of feudal anarchy; but the policy of each was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>necessarily modified by changing times and needs. The
foundations of the whole were laid by the Conqueror,
whose character and circumstances combined to afford
him an opportunity unparalleled in history. The difficulties
of his task, and the methods by which he carried
it to a successful issue, are best understood in relation
to the nature of the opposition he had to dread. Feudalism
was the great current of the age—a tide formed by
many converging streams, all flowing in the same direction,
unreasoning like the blind powers of Nature, carrying
away and submerging every obstacle in its path. In
other parts of Europe—in Germany, France, and Italy, as
in Scotland—the ablest monarchs found their thrones
undermined by this feudal current. In England alone
the monarchy made headway against the flood. William I.
wisely refrained from any mad attempt to stay the
torrent; but, while accepting it, he quietly subjected it
to his own purposes. He carefully watched and
modified the tendencies making for feudalism, which he
found in England on his arrival, and he profoundly
altered the feudal usages and rights which his followers
transplanted from the Norman soil. The special expedients
used by him for this purpose are well known, and
are all closely connected with his crafty policy of
balancing the Anglo-Saxon basis of his rule against the
imported Norman superstructure, and of selecting at his
own discretion such elements as suited him in either. He
encouraged the adoption or intensification in England of
feudalism, considered as a system of land tenure and as
a system of social distinctions based on the possession
of land; but he successfully endeavoured to check the
evils of its unrestrained growth in its other equally
important aspects, namely, as a system of local government
seeking to be independent of the Crown, and as a system
of jurisdiction. As a political system, it was always a
subject of suspicion to William, for he viewed it in the
light of his double experience in Normandy as feudal
lord and feudal vassal.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>William’s policy was one of balancing. His whole
career in England was characteristically inaugurated by
his care to support his claim to the throne on a double
basis. Not content to depend merely on the right of
conquest, he insisted on having his title confirmed by a
body claiming to represent the old Witenagemot of England,
and he further alleged that he had been formally
named as successor by his kinsman, Edward Confessor,
a nomination strengthened by the renunciation of Harold
in his favour. Thus, to his Norman followers claiming
to have set him by force of arms on his throne, William
might point to the form of election by the Witan, while
for his English subjects, claiming to have elected him, the
presence of the foreign troops was an even more effective
argument. Throughout his reign, his plan was to balance
the old English laws and institutions against the new
Norman ones, with himself as umpire over all. Thus he
retained whatever suited him in Anglo-Saxon customs.
Roger of Hoveden tells us how, in the fourth year of his
reign, twelve of the subject English from each county—noble,
wise, and learned in the laws—were summoned to
recite on oath the old customs of the land.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> He retained,
too, the old popular moots or meetings of the shire and
hundred as a counterpoise to the feudal jurisdictions; the
fyrd or militia of all free men as a set-off to the feudal
levy; and such of the incidents of the old Anglo-Saxon
tenures of land as met his requirements.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the subject English, with their customs and
ancient institutions, were used as expedients for modifying
the excesses of feudalism. William, however, did not
shrink from innovations where these suited his purpose.
The great earldoms into which England had been divided,
even down to the Norman Conquest, were abolished.
New earldoms were indeed created, but on an entirely
different basis. Even the great officers, subsequently
known as Earls Palatine, always few in number, never
attained either to the extent of territory or to the independence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of the Anglo-Saxon ealdormen. William was
chary of creating even ordinary earls, and such as he
did create soon became mere holders of empty titles of
honour, while they found themselves ousted from all real
power by the Norman <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vicecomites</i></span> or sheriffs. No English
earl was a “count” in the continental sense (that is, a
real ruler of a “county”). Further, no earl was allowed
to hold too large an estate within his titular shire; and
William, while compelled to reward his followers’ services
with great possessions, was careful that these should be
split up in widely scattered districts of his Kingdom.
Thus the great feudatories were prevented from consolidating
their resources against the Crown.</p>

<p class='c001'>Various ingenious devices were used for checking the
feudal excesses so prevalent on the continent. Rights of
private war, coinage, and castle-building, were jealously
watched and circumscribed; while private jurisdictions,
although tolerated as a necessary evil, were kept within
bounds. The manor was in England the normal unit of
seignorial jurisdiction, and higher courts of Honours were
so exceptional as to be a negligible quantity. No feudal
appeal lay from the manorial court of one magnate to
that of his over-lord, while, in later reigns at least,
appeals were encouraged to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Curia Regis</cite></span>. Almost at
the close of William’s reign a new encroachment upon
the feudal spirit was accomplished, when the Conqueror
on Salisbury Plain compelled all freeholders to take an
oath of homage and fealty personally to the king.</p>

<p class='c001'>The results of this policy have been well summarized
as “a strong monarchy, a relatively weak baronage,
and a homogeneous people.”</p>

<p class='c001'>During the reign of William II. (1087-1100) the constitution
made no conspicuous advance. The foundations
had been laid; but Rufus was more intent on his hunting
and enjoyments, than on the deeper matters of statecraft.
Some minor details of feudal organization were doubtless
settled and defined in these thirteen years by the King’s
Treasurer, Ralph Flambard; but the extent to which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>innovated on the practice of the elder William is matter
of dispute. On the whole, the reign must be considered
as a time of rest between two periods of advance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Henry I. (1100-35) took up, with far-seeing statesman’s
eye and much vigour, the work of consolidation. His policy
shows an advance upon that of his father. William had
contented himself with controlling and curbing the main
vices of feudalism, while he played off against it the English
native institutions. Henry went further, and introduced
within the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Curia Regis</cite></span> itself a new class of men representing
a new principle of government. The great offices of
state, previously held by men of baronial rank, were now
filled with creatures of Henry’s own, men of humble birth,
whose merit had raised them to his favour, and whose only
title to power lay in his goodwill. The employment of
this strictly professional class of administrators was one
of the chief contributions made by Henry to the growth
of the constitution. His other great achievement was the
organization of the Exchequer, primarily as a source of
royal revenue, but soon found useful as a means of making
his will felt in every corner of England. For this great
work he was fortunate to secure in Roger, Bishop of Salisbury,
the help of a man who combined genius with painstaking
ability. At the Exchequer, as organized by the
King and his minister, the sheriff of each county twice
a year, at Easter and at Michaelmas, rendered account of
every payment that had passed through his hands. His
balance was adjusted before all the great officers of the
King’s household, who subjected his accounts to close
scrutiny and criticism. Official records were drawn up,
one of which—the famous Pipe Roll of 1130,—is extant at
the present day. As the sums received by the sheriff
affected every class of society in town and country, these
half-yearly audits enabled the King’s advisers to scrutinize
the lives and conduct of every one of importance in the
land. These half-yearly investigations were rendered more
effective by the existence at the Exchequer of a great record
of every landed estate in England. With this the sheriffs’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>returns could be checked and compared. Henry’s Exchequer
thus found one of its most powerful weapons in
the great Domesday Survey, the most enduring proof of the
statesmanship of the Conqueror, by whose orders and under
whose direction it had been compiled.</p>

<p class='c001'>The central scrutiny conducted within the two chambers
of the Exchequer was supplemented by occasional inspections
conducted in each county. The King’s representatives,
including among them usually some of the officers whose
duty it was to preside over the half-yearly audit, visited,
at intervals still irregular, the various shires. These Eyres,
as they were called, were at first chiefly undertaken for
financial purposes. The main object was to check, on the
scene of their labours, the statements made at Westminster
by the various sheriffs. From the first, such financial investigations
necessarily involved the trial of pleas. Complaints
of oppression at the hands of the local tyrant of
the county were naturally made and determined on the
spot; gradually, but not until a later reign, the judicial
business became equally important with the financial, and
ultimately even more important.</p>

<p class='c001'>Henry at his death in 1135 seemed to have carried
nearly to completion his congenial task of building a strong
monarchy on the foundations laid by William I. Much of
his work was, however, for a time undone, while all of it
seemed in imminent danger of perishing for ever, because
he left no male heir of his body to succeed him on the
throne. His daughter’s claims were set aside by Stephen,
the son of the Conqueror’s daughter, and a cadet of the
House of Blois, to whom Henry had played the indulgent
uncle, and who repaid his benefactor’s generosity by constituting
himself his heir. From the first moment of his
reign, Stephen proved unequal to the task of preserving the
monarchy intact from the wild forces that beat around the
throne. His failure is attributed by some to his personal
characteristics, and by others to the defective nature of his
title, combined with the presence of a rival in the field in
the person of his cousin, Henry’s daughter, the ex-Empress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Matilda. The nineteen years of anarchy which nominally
formed his reign did nothing—and worse than nothing—to
continue the work of his great ancestors. The power of
the Crown was humbled, and England was almost torn in
fragments by the selfish claims of rival feudal magnates
to local independence.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the accession of Henry II. (1154) the tide quickly
turned, and turned for good.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the numerous steps taken by Henry Plantagenet to
complete the work of the earlier master-builders of the
English monarchy, only a few need here be mentioned.
Ascending the throne in early manhood, he brought with
him a statesman’s instinct peculiar to himself, together with
the unconquerable energy common to his race. He rapidly
overhauled every existing institution and every branch of
administration. The permanent <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Curia Regis</cite></span> was not only
restored to efficient working order, but was improved in each
one of its many aspects—as the King’s household, as a
financial bureau, as the administrative centre of the entire
kingdom, and as the special vehicle of royal justice. The
Exchequer, which was indeed originally merely the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Curia</cite></span> in
its financial aspect, received the re-organization so urgently
needed after the terrible strains to which it had been subjected
amid the quarrels of Stephen and Matilda. The Pipe
Rolls were revived and various minor reforms in financial
matters effected. All local courts (both the old popular
courts of hundred and county, and also the feudal jurisdictions)
were brought under the more effective control of
the central government by various expedients. Chief
among these was the restoration of the system of Eyres
with their travelling justices (a natural supplement to the
restoration of the Exchequer), whose visits were now placed
on a more regular and systematic basis. Equally important
were the King’s personal care in the selection of fit men for
the duties of sheriff, the frequent punishments and removal
from office of offenders, and the rigid insistence upon
efficient training and uprightness in all who enjoyed places
of authority under the Crown. Henry was strong enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>to employ more substantial men than the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>novi homines</i></span> of
his grandfather without suffering them to be less devoted to
the interests of their Prince. Yet another expedient for
controlling local courts was the calling up of cases to his
own central feudal <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia</i></span>, or before those benches of professional
judges, the future King’s Bench and Common
Pleas, forming as yet merely committees of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia</i></span> as
a whole.</p>

<p class='c001'>Closely connected with the control thus established over
the local courts was the new system of procedure instituted
by Henry. The chief feature was that each litigation must
commence with an appropriate royal writ issued from the
Chancery. Soon for each class of action was devised a
special writ appropriate to itself, and the entire procedure
came to be known as "the writ process"—an important
system to which English jurisprudence owes both its form
and the direction of its growth. Many reforms which at
first sight seem connected merely with minute points of
legal procedure were really fraught with immense purport
to the subsequent development of English law and
English liberties. A great future was reserved for certain
expedients adopted by Henry for the settlement of disputes
as to the possession or ownership of land, and also for
certain expedients for reforming criminal justice instituted
or systematized by a great ordinance, issued in 1166,
known as the Assize of Clarendon.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a> A striking feature
of Henry’s policy was the bold manner in which he
threw open the doors of his royal Courts of Law to
all-comers, and provided there—always in return for hard
cash, be it said—a better article in name of justice
than could be procured elsewhere in England, or for that
matter, elsewhere in Europe. Thus, not only was the
Exchequer filled with fines and fees, but, insidiously and
without the danger involved in a frontal attack, Henry
sapped the strength of the great feudal magnates, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>diverted the stream of litigants from the manorial courts to
his own. The same policy had still another result in
facilitating the growth of a body of common law, uniform
throughout the length and breadth of England, and opposed
to the varying usages of localities or even of individual
baronial courts.</p>

<p class='c001'>These reforms, besides influencing the current of events
in England in numerous ways, both direct and indirect, all
helped to strengthen the throne of Henry and his sons.
Another class of reforms contributed greatly to the same
result, namely, the reorganization of the army. This was
effected in various ways: partly by the revival and more
strict enforcement of the obligations connected with the
old Anglo-Saxon fyrd or militia, under the Assize of
Arms in 1181, which compelled every freeman to maintain
at his own expense weapons and warlike equipment suited
to his station in life; partly by the ingenious method of
increasing the amount of feudal service due from Crown
tenants, based upon an investigation instituted by the
Crown and upon the written replies returned by the barons,
known to historians as “the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Cartae</i></span> of 1166”; and partly
by the development (not, as is usually supposed, the <em>invention</em>)
of the principle of scutage, a means whereby unwilling
military service, limited as it was by annoying restrictions
as to time and place, might be exchanged at the option of
the Crown for money, with which a more flexible army of
mercenaries might be hired.</p>

<p class='c001'>By these expedients, along with many others, Henry
raised the English monarchy, always in the ascendant since
the Conquest, to the very zenith of its power, and left to
his sons the entire machinery of government in perfect
working order, combining high administrative efficiency
with great strength. Full of bitter strifes and troubles as
his reign of thirty-five years had been, nothing had interfered
with the vigour and success of the policy whereby he
tightened his hold on England. Neither the long bitter
struggle with Becket and the Church, ending as it did
in Henry’s personal humiliation, nor the unnatural warfare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>with his sons, which involved the depths of personal suffering
to the King and hastened his death in 1189, was
allowed to interfere with his projects of reform in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last twenty years of his life had been darkened for
him, and proved troubled and anarchic in the extreme to
his continental dominions; but in England profound peace
reigned. The last serious revolt of the powers of feudal
anarchy had been suppressed in 1173 with characteristic
thoroughness and moderation. After that date, the English
monarchy retained its supremacy almost without an effort.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>II. William I. to Henry II.—Problem of Local Government.</h3>

<p class='c016'>It is necessary to leave for a time the English monarchy
at its zenith, still enjoying in 1189 the powers and reputation
gained for it by Henry of Anjou, and to retrace our
steps, in order to consider two subsidiary problems, each of
which requires separate treatment—the problem of local
government, and that of the relations between Church and
State. The failure of the Princes of the House of Wessex
to devise adequate machinery for keeping the Danish and
Anglian provinces in subjection to their will was one main
source of the weakness of their monarchy. When Duke
William solved this problem he took an enormous stride
towards establishing his throne on a securer basis.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every age has to face, in its own way, a group of
difficulties essentially the same, although assuming such
different names as Home Rule, Local Government, or
Federation. Problems as to the proper nature of the
local authority, the extent of the powers with which it
may be safely entrusted, and its relation to the central
government, require constantly to be solved. The difficulties
involved, always great, were unspeakably greater in
an age when practically no administrative machinery
existed, and when rapid communication and serviceable
roads were unknown. A lively sympathy is excited by a
consideration of the almost insuperable difficulties that
beset the path of King Edgar or King Ethelred, endeavouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>to rule from Winchester the distant tribes of
alien races inhabiting Northumbria, Mercia, and East
Anglia. If such a king placed a weakling as ruler over
any distant province, anarchy would result and his own
authority might be endangered along with that of his
inefficient representative. Yet, if he entrusted the rule
of that province to too strong a man, he might find his
suzerainty shaken off by a viceroy who had consolidated
his position and then defied his king. Here, then, are
the two horns of a dilemma, both of which are illustrated
by the course of early English history. When Wessex
had established some measure of authority over rival
states, and was fast growing into England, the policy
at first followed was simply to leave each province
under its old native line of rulers, who now admitted a
nominal dependence on the King who ruled at Winchester.
The early West-Saxon Princes vacillated between two
opposite lines of policy. Spasmodic attempts at centralization
alternated with the reverse policy of local autonomy.
In the days when Dunstan united the spiritual duties of
the See of Canterbury to the temporal duties of chief
adviser to King Edgar, the problem of local government
became urgent. Dunstan’s scheme has sometimes been
described as a federal or home-rule policy—as a frank
surrender of the attempt to control exclusively from one
centre the mixed populations of Northern and Midland
England. His attempted solution was to loosen rather
than to tighten further the bond; to entrust with wide
powers and franchises the local viceroy or ealdorman in
each district, and so to be content with a loose federal
empire—a union of hearts rather than a centralized
despotism founded on coercion. The dangers of such a
system are the more obvious when it is remembered
that each ealdorman commanded the troops of his own
province.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cnut’s policy has been the subject of much discussion,
and has sometimes apparently been misunderstood. The
better opinion is that, with his Danish troops behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>him, he felt strong enough to reverse Dunstan’s tactics
and to take a decisive step in the direction of centralization
or unity. His provincial viceroys (jarls or earls, as they
were now called, rather than by their old vague title of
ealdormen), were appointed on an entirely new basis.
England was to be mapped out into new administrative
districts in the hope of obliterating the old tribal divisions.
Each of these was to be placed under a viceroy having
no hereditary or dynastic connection with the province
he governed. In this way, Cnut sought to avert the
process by which the country was slowly breaking up into
a number of petty kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c001'>If these viceroys were a source of strength to the powerful
Cnut, they were a source of weakness to the saintly
Confessor, who was forced to submit to the control of
his provincial rulers, such as Godwin and Leofric, as each
in turn gained the upper hand in the field or in the
Witan. This process of disintegration continued until
the coming of the Conqueror utterly changed the relations
of the monarchy to every other factor in the national
life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the expedients adopted by the Norman Duke
for reducing his feudatories in England into subjection to
the Crown, one of the most important was the total abolition
of the old provinces formerly governed by separate
ealdormen or jarls. Leaving out of account the exceptional
franchises, afterwards known as palatine earldoms,
the real representative of the King in each group of
counties was now the sheriff or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vicecomes</i></span>, not the earl.
This Latin name of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vicecomes</i></span> is misleading, since the
officer so-called in no sense represented the earl or
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>comes</i></span>, but acted as the direct agent of the Crown.
The name, “viceroy,” more accurately describes his actual
position and functions, since he was directly responsible to
the Crown, and independent of the earl. The problem of
local government, however, was not eradicated by the
substitution of the sheriff for the earl as chief magistrate
in the county; it only took a different form. The sheriffs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>themselves, when relieved from the earl’s rivalry and
control, tended to become too powerful. If they never
dreamed of openly defying the royal power, they at least
thwarted its exercise indirectly, appropriated to their
private uses items of revenue, pushed their own interests,
and punished their own enemies, while acting in the name
of the King. The office threatened to become territorial
and hereditary,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and its holders aimed at independence.
New checks had to be devised to prevent this new local
authority from again defying the central power. New
safeguards were found, partly in the organization of the
Exchequer and partly in the device of sending periodically
on circuit itinerant justices, who took precedence of the
sheriff, heard complaints against his misdeeds in his own
county, and thus enabled the Crown to keep a watchful
eye on its representatives. By such measures, Henry I.
seemed almost to have solved these problems before his
death; but his success was apparent rather than real.</p>

<p class='c001'>The incompleteness of Henry’s solution of the difficulty
became evident under Stephen, when the leading noble of
each locality tried, generally with success, to capture <em>both</em>
offices for himself; great earls like Ralph of Chester and
Geoffrey of Essex compelled the King not only to confirm
them as sheriffs in their own titular counties, but also to
confer on them exclusive right to act as justices therein.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the accession of Henry II. the problem was, thanks
to his energy and genius, more satisfactorily solved, or at
least forced once more into the background. That great
ruler was strong enough to prevent the growth of the
hereditary principle as applied to offices either of the
Household or of local magistrates. The sheriffs were
frequently changed, not only by the drastic and unique
measure known as the Inquest of Sheriffs, but systematically,
and as a normal expedient of administration. For
the time being, the local government was kept in proper
subjection to the Crown; and gradually the problem
solved itself. The power of the sheriffs tended in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>thirteenth century to decrease, chiefly because they found
important rivals not only in the itinerant judges, but also
in two new officers first heard of in the reign of Richard I.,
the forerunners of the modern Coroner and Justice of the
Peace respectively. All fear that the sheriffs as administrative
heads of districts would assert practical independence
of the Crown was thus at an end. Yet each of them
still remained a petty tyrant over the inhabitants of his
own bailiwick. While the Crown was able and willing
to avenge any direct neglect of its own interests, it was
not always sufficiently alert to avenge wrongs inflicted
upon its humble subjects. The problem of local government,
then, was fast losing its pressing importance as
regards the Crown, and taking a new form, namely, the
necessity of protecting the weak from unjust fines and
oppressions inflicted on them by local magistrates. The
sheriff’s local power was no longer a source of weakness to
the monarch, but had become an effective part of the
machinery which enabled the Crown to levy with impunity
its always increasing taxation.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III. William I. to Henry II.—Problem of Church and State.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The national Church had been, from an early date, in
tacit alliance with the Crown. The friendly aid of a long
line of statesman-prelates from Dunstan downwards had
given to the Anglo-Saxon monarchy much of the little
strength it possessed. Before the Conquest the connection
between Church and State had been exceedingly close, so
much so that no one thought of drawing a sharp dividing
line between. What afterwards became two separate
entities, drifting more and more into active opposition,
were at first merely two aspects of one whole—a whole
which comprehended all classes of the people, considered
both in their spiritual and their temporal relations.
Change necessarily came with the Norman Conquest, when
the English Church was brought into closer contact with
Rome, and with the ecclesiastical ideals prevailing on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Continent. Yet no fundamental alteration resulted; the
friendly relations which bound the English prelates to the
English throne remained intact, while English churchmen
continued to look to Canterbury, rather than to Rome, for
guidance. The Church, in William the Conqueror’s new
realm, retained more of a national character than could be
found in any other nation of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>Gratitude to the Pope for his moral support in the
work of the Conquest never modified William’s determination
to allow no unwarranted papal interference in his
new domains. His letter, both outspoken and courteous,
in reply to papal demands is still extant. “I refuse to
do fealty nor will I, because neither have I promised it,
nor do I find that my predecessors did it to your predecessors.”
Peter’s pence he was willing to pay at the
rate recognized by his Saxon predecessors; but all encroachments
would be politely repelled.</p>

<p class='c001'>In settling the country newly reduced to his domination,
the Duke of Normandy found his most valuable adviser
in a former Abbot of the Norman Abbey of Bec, whom
he raised to be Primate of all England. No record has
come down to us of any serious dispute between William
and Lanfranc.</p>

<p class='c001'>Substantially friendly relations between their successors
in the offices of King and Archbishop remained, notwithstanding
Anselm’s condemnation of the evil deeds of Rufus.
Anselm warmly supported that King’s authority over the
Norman magnates, even while he resented his evil practices
towards the Church. He contented himself with a
dignified protest (made emphatic by a withdrawal of his
presence from England) against the new exactions upon
the English prelates, and against the long intervals during
which vacancies remained unfilled. Returning at Rufus’s
death from a sort of honourable banishment at Rome, to aid
Henry in maintaining order and gaining peaceable accession
to the throne, Anselm found himself compelled by
his conscience and the recent decrees of a Lateran Council,
to enter on the great struggle of the investitures. Church
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and State were gradually disentangling themselves from
each other; but in many respects the spiritual and temporal
powers were still indissolubly locked together. In
particular, every bishop was a vassal of the king, holder
of a Crown barony, as well as a prelate of Holy Church.
By whom, then, should a bishop be appointed, by the
spiritual or by the temporal power? Could he without sin
perform homage for the estates of his See? Who ought to
invest him with ring and crozier, the symbols of his office
as a shepherd of souls? Anselm adopted one view, Henry
the other. A happy compromise, suggested by the King’s
statesmanship, healed the breach for the time being. The
ring and crozier, as badges of spiritual authority, were
to be conferred only by the Church, but each prelate
must perform fealty to the King before receiving these
symbols, and must do homage thereafter, but before he was
actually anointed as bishop. Canonical election was nominally
conceded by the King; but here again a practical
check was devised for rendering this power innocuous.
The members of the cathedral chapter were confirmed in
the theoretic right to appoint whom they pleased, but such
appointment must be made in the King’s Court or Chapel,
thus affording the powerful monarch full knowledge of the
proceedings, and an opportunity of being present and of
practically forcing the selection of his own candidate.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Church gained much in power during Stephen’s
reign, and deserved the power it gained, since it remained
the only stable centre of good government, while
all other institutions crumbled around it. It was not
unnatural that churchmen should advance new claims,
and we find them adopting the watchword, afterwards so
famous, “that the Church should be free,” a vague phrase
doubtless, destined to be embodied in Magna Carta. The
extent of immunity thus claimed was never clearly defined,
and this vagueness was probably intentional, since an
elastic phrase might be expanded to keep pace with the
ever-growing pretensions of the Church. Churchmen made
it clear, however, that they meant it to include at the least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>two principles—those rights afterwards known as “benefit
of clergy,” and “canonical election” respectively.</p>

<p class='c001'>Henry II.’s attempt to force a clear definition, embodied
in the Constitutions of Clarendon in 1164, signally failed,
chiefly through the miscarriage of his plans consequent on
the murder of Becket. Yet the rights of the Church,
although remaining theoretically unaltered from the days of
Stephen, felt the pressure directed by Henry’s energetic
arm against all claims of privilege. Rights, theoretically
the same, shrank to smaller practical limits when measured
against the strength of Henry as compared with the
weakness of Stephen. Canonical election thus remained
at the close of the reign of Henry II. the same farce it
had been in the days of Henry I. The “election” lay
with the chapter of the vacant See; but the king told
them plainly whom to elect. The other rights of the
Church as actually enjoyed at the close of the reign of
Henry Plantagenet were not far different from what had
been set down in the Constitutions of Clarendon, although
these never received formal recognition by Canterbury or
by Rome. So matters stood between Church and State
when the throne of England was bequeathed by Henry
to his sons. It remained for John’s rash provocation,
followed by his quick and cowardly retreat, to compel
a new definition of the frontier between the spiritual and
the temporal powers.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IV. Richard I. and John.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Henry II. before his death had fulfilled the task of
restoring order, to which destiny had called him. To
effect this, he had brought to perfection machinery of
government of rare excellence, and equally well adapted
for purposes of taxation, of dispensing justice, and of general
administration. Great as was the power for good of
this new instrument in the hands of a wise and justice-loving
king, it was equally powerful for evil in the hands
of an arrogant and unjust, or even of a careless monarch.
All the old enemies of the Crown had been crushed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Local government, as now systematized, formed a source
of strength, not of weakness; while the Church, whose
highest offices were now filled with officials trained in
Henry’s own Household and Exchequer (ecclesiastics in
name only, differing widely from saintly monks like
Anselm), still remained the fast friend of the Crown. The
monarchy was strong enough to defy any one section of
the nation, and no inclination was yet apparent among
the estates of the realm to make common cause against
the throne.</p>

<p class='c001'>The very thoroughness with which the Crown had
surmounted all its early difficulties, induced in Henry’s
successors, men born in the purple, an exaggerated feeling
of security, and a tendency to overreach themselves by
excessive arrogance. At the same time, the very abjectness
of the various factors of the nation, now prostrate beneath
the heel of the Crown, prepared them to sink their mutual
suspicions and to form a tacit alliance in order to join issue
with their common oppressor. Powers used moderately and
on the whole for national ends by Henry, were abused for
purely selfish ends by his sons in succession. Richard’s
heavy taxation and contemptuous indifference to English
interests gradually reconciled men’s minds to thoughts of
change, and prepared the basis of a combined opposition
to a power which threatened to grind all other powers to
powder.</p>

<p class='c001'>In no direction were these abuses felt so severely as
in taxation. Financial machinery had been elaborated to
perfection, and large additional sums could be squeezed
from every class in the nation by an extra turn of the
screw. Richard did not even require to incur the odium
of this, since the ministers, who were his instruments,
shielded him from the unpopularity of his measures, while
he pursued his own good pleasure abroad in war and
tournament without even condescending to visit the subjects
he oppressed. Twice only, for a few months in each
case, did Richard visit England during a reign of ten
years.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>In his absence new methods of taxation were devised,
and new classes of property subjected to it; in especial,
personal effects—merchandise and other chattels—only
once before (in 1187 for the Saladin tithe) placed under
contribution, were now made a regular source of royal
revenue. The isolated precedent of Henry’s reign was gladly
followed when an extraordinarily heavy burden had to be
borne by the nation to produce the ransom exacted for
Richard’s release from prison. The very heartiness with
which England made sacrifices to succour the Monarch
in his hour of need, was turned against the tax-payers.
Richard showed no gratitude; and, being devoid of all
kindly interest in his subjects, he argued that what had
been paid once might equally well be paid again. Thus he
formed exaggerated notions of the revenue to be extracted
from England. From abroad he sent demand after demand
to his overworked justiciars for ever-increasing sums of
money. The chief lessons of the reign are connected with
this excessive taxation, and the consequent discontent
which prepared the way for the new grouping of political
forces under John.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some minor lessons may be noted:</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) In Richard’s absence the odium for his exactions
fell upon his ministers at home, who thus bore the burden
meet for his own callous shoulders, while he enjoyed an
undeserved popularity by reason of his bravery and
achievements, exaggerated as these were by the halo of
romance which surrounds a distant hero. Thus may be
traced some dim foreshadowing of the doctrine of ministerial
responsibility, although such analogies with modern politics
must not be pushed too far.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) Throughout the reign, many parts of Henry’s system,
technical details of taxation and reforms in the administration
of justice, were elaborated by Archbishop Hubert
Walter. Principles closely connected with trial by jury
on the one hand and with election and representation on
the other were being quietly developed—destined to play
an important rôle in other ages.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>(3) Richard is sometimes said to have inaugurated the
golden age of municipalities. Undoubtedly many charters
still extant bear witness to the lavish hand with which he
granted, on paper at least, franchises and privileges to the
nascent towns. John Richard Green finds the true interest
of the reign not in the King’s Crusades and French
wars, so much as in his fostering care over the growth
of municipal enterprise. The importance of the consequences
of such a policy is not diminished by the fact that
Richard acted from sordid motives—selling privileges, too
often of a purely nominal character, as he sold everything
else which would fetch a price.</p>

<p class='c001'>The death of Richard on 6th April, 1199, brought with
it at least one important change; England was no longer to
be governed by an absentee. John, as impatient of control
as he was incompetent, endeavoured to shake himself free
from the restraints of powerful ministers, and determined
to conduct the work of government in his own way. The
result was an abrupt end to the progress made in the
previous reign towards ministerial responsibility. The
odium formerly exhausting itself on the justiciars of
Richard was now expended on John. While, previously,
men had sought redress in a change of minister, such vain
expectations could no longer deceive. A new element of
bitterness was added to injuries long resented, and the
nobles who felt the pinch of heavy taxation were compelled
to seek redress in an entirely new direction. All the forces
of discontent played openly around the throne.</p>

<p class='c001'>As is usual at the opening of a new reign, the discontented
hoped that a change of sovereign would bring some
relief. The excessive taxation of the late reign had been the
result of exceptional circumstances. It was expected that
the new King would revert to the less burdensome scale of
his father’s financial measures. Such hopes were quickly
disappointed. John’s needs proved as great as Richard’s,
and the money he obtained was used for purposes that
appealed to no one but himself. The excessive exactions
demanded both in money and in service, coupled with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>unpopular uses to which these were put, form the keynote
of the whole reign. They form also the background of
Magna Carta.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reign falls naturally into three periods; the years
in which John waged a losing war with the King of
France (1199-1206), the quarrel with the Pope (1206-13),
the great struggle of John with the barons (1213-16).</p>

<p class='c001'>The first seven years were for England comparatively
uneventful, except in the gradual deepening of disgust
with John and all his ways. The continental dominions
were ripe for losing, and John precipitated the catastrophe
by his injustice and dilatoriness. The ease with which
Normandy was lost shows something more than the incapacity
of the King as a ruler and leader—John Softsword
as contemporary writers contemptuously call him. It
shows that the feudal army of Normandy had come to
regard the English Sovereign as an alien monarch, and
refused to fight in support of the rule of a foreigner. The
unwillingness of the English nobles to succour John actively
has also its significance. The descendants of the men who
helped William I. to conquer England had now lost all
interest in the land from which they came. They were
now purely English landowners, and very different from
the original Norman baronage whose interests, like their
estates, had been equally divided on both sides of the
Channel.</p>

<p class='c001'>The death of Archbishop Hubert Walter in July, 1205,
deprived King John of the services of the most experienced
statesman in England. It did more, for it marked the
termination of the long friendship between the English
Crown and the National Church. Its immediate effect
was to create a vacancy, the filling of which led to a
bitter quarrel with Rome.</p>

<p class='c001'>John failed, as usual, to recognize the merits of abler
men, and saw in the death of his great Justiciar and
Archbishop only the removal of an unwelcome restraint,
and the opening to the Crown of a desirable piece of
patronage. He prepared to strain to the utmost his rights
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>in the election of a successor to the See of Canterbury,
in favour of one of his own creatures, a certain John de
Grey, already by royal influence Bishop of Norwich.
Unexpected opposition to his will was offered by the
canons of the Cathedral Church, who determined on a bold
policy, namely, to turn their nominal right of canonical election
into a reality, and to appoint their own nominee, without
waiting either for the King’s approval or the co-operation
of the suffragan bishops of the Province, who, during the
last three vacancies, had put forth a claim to participate
in the election, and had invariably used their influence
on behalf of the King’s nominee. Reginald, the sub-prior,
was secretly elected by the monks, and hurried abroad
to obtain confirmation at Rome before the appointment was
made public. Reginald’s vanity prevented his keeping his
pledge of secrecy, and a rumour reached the ear of John,
who brought pressure to bear on the monks, now frightened
at their own temerity, and secured de Grey’s appointment
in a second election. The Bishop of Norwich was actually
enthroned at Canterbury, and invested by the King with
the temporalities of the See. All parties now sent representatives
to Rome. This somewhat petty squabble
benefited none of the original disputants; for the astute
Innocent III. was quick to see an opportunity for papal
aggrandisement. Both elections were set aside by decree
of the Papal Curia, and the emissaries of the various
parties were coerced or persuaded to appoint there and
then in the Pope’s presence the Pope’s own nominee,
a certain Cardinal, English-born, but hitherto little known
in England, Stephen Langton by name, destined to play
an important part in the future history of the land of
his birth.</p>

<p class='c001'>John refused to view this triumph of papal arrogance
in the light of a compromise—the view diplomatically
suggested by Innocent. The King, with the hot blood
common to his race, and the bad judgment peculiar to
himself, rushed headlong into a quarrel with Rome which
he was incapable of carrying to a successful issue. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>details of the struggle, the interdicts and excommunications
hurled by the Pope, and John’s measures of retaliation
against the unfortunate English clergy, need not be discussed,
since they do not directly affect the main plot
which culminated at Runnymede.</p>

<p class='c001'>John was not without some measure of sagacity of a
selfish and short-sighted sort, but was completely devoid of
far-seeing statecraft. One day he was to reap the fruits
of this quarrel in bitter humiliation and in the defeat of his
most cherished aims; but, for the moment, the breach with
Rome seemed to lead to a triumph for the King. The
papal encroachments furnished him with a suitable pretext
for confiscating the property of the clergy. Thus his Exchequer
was amply replenished, while he was able for a
time to conciliate his most inveterate opponents, the
Northern barons, by remitting during several years the
hated burden of a scutage, which, in other periods of his
reign, tended to become a yearly imposition. John had no
intention, however, to forego his right to resume the practice
of annual scutages whenever it suited him to do so. On
the contrary, he executed a measure intended to make
them more remunerative in the future. This was the great
Inquest of Service ordered on 1st June, 1212.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>During these years, however, John temporarily relaxed
the pressure on his feudal tenants. His doing so failed to
gain back any of their goodwill, while he broadened the
basis of future resistance by shifting his oppressions to the
clergy and through them to the poor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some incidents of the autumn of 1212 require brief
notice, as well from their own inherent interest as because
they find an echo in the words of Magna Carta. Serious
trouble had arisen with Wales. Llywelyn (who had
married John’s natural daughter Joan, and had consolidated
his power under protection of the English King) now
seized the occasion to cross the border, while John was
preparing his schemes for a new continental expedition.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The King changed his plans, and prepared to lead his
troops to Wales instead of France. A muster was summoned
for September at Nottingham, and John went
thither to meet them. Before tasting meat, as we are
told in Roger of Wendover’s graphic narrative, he hanged
twenty-eight Welsh hostages, boys of noble family, whom
he held as sureties that Llywelyn would keep the peace.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Almost immediately thereafter, two messengers arrived
simultaneously from Scotland and from Wales with unexpected
tidings. John’s daughter, Joan, and the King of
Scots, each independently warned him that his English
barons were prepared to revolt, under shelter of the Pope’s
absolution from their allegiance, and either to slay him or
betray him to the Welsh. The King dared not afford them
so good an opportunity. In a panic he disbanded the
feudal levies; and, accompanied only by his mercenaries,
moved slowly back to London.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Two of the barons, Robert Fitz-Walter, afterwards the
Marshal of the army which, later on, opposed John at
Runnymede, and Eustace de Vesci, showed their knowledge
of John’s suspicions (if they did not justify them) by
withdrawing secretly from his Court and taking to flight.
The King caused them to be outlawed in their absence, and
thereafter seized their estates and demolished their castles.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These events of September, 1212, rudely shook John
out of the false sense of security in which he had wrapped
himself a few months earlier. In the Spring of the same
year, he had still seemed to enjoy the full tide of prosperity;
and he must have been a bold prophet who dared to
foretell, as Peter of Wakefield did foretell, the speedy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>downfall of the King—a prophecy the main purport of
which (although not the details), was actually accomplished.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John’s apparent security was deceptive; he had underestimated
the powers arrayed against him. Before the end
of that year he had realized, in a sudden flash of
illumination, that the Pope was too strong for him, circumstanced
as he then was. It may well be that, if John’s
throne had rested on a solid basis of his subjects’
love, he might have defied with impunity the thunders of
Rome; but, although he was still an unrestrained despot,
his despotism now rested on a hollow foundation. His
barons, particularly the eager spirits of the north, refrained
from open rebellion merely until a fit opportunity should
be offered them. The papal excommunication of a King
relieved his subjects of their oaths of allegiance, and this
might render their deliberate revolt dangerous and perhaps
fatal. At this critical juncture Innocent played his leading
card, inviting the King of France to act as the executor
of the sentence of excommunication against his brother
King. John at once realized that the time had come to
make his peace with Rome.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps we should admire the sudden inspiration which
showed the King that his game had been played and lost,
while we regret the humiliation of his surrender, and the
former blindness which could not see a little way ahead.</p>

<p class='c001'>On 13th May, 1213, John met Pandulf, the papal legate,
and accepted unconditionally his demands, the same which
he had refused contemptuously some months before. Full
reparation was to be made to the Church. Stephen
Langton was to be received as archbishop in all honour
with his banished bishops, friends and kinsmen. All
church property was to be restored, with compensation
for damage done. One of the minor conditions of John’s
absolution was the restoration to Eustace de Vesci and Robert
Fitz-Walter of the estates which they persuaded Innocent
had been forfeited because of their loyalty to Rome.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>John’s humiliation did not stop even here. Two days
later he resigned the Crowns of England and Ireland, and
received them again as the Pope’s feudatory, promising
to perform personal homage should occasion allow. Such
was the price which the King was now ready to pay for
the Pope’s active alliance against his enemies at home and
abroad, the former submission having merely bought off the
excommunication. John hoped thus to disentangle himself
from his growing difficulties, and so to be free to avenge
himself on his baronial enemies. The surrender of the
Crown was embodied in a formal legal document which
bears to be made by John, “with the common council of
our barons.” Were these merely words of form? They
may have been so when first used; yet two years later
the envoys of the insurgent barons claimed at Rome
that the credit (so they now represented it) for the whole
transaction lay with them. Perhaps the barons did consent
to the surrender, thinking that to make the Pope lord
paramount of England would protect the inhabitants from
the irresponsible tyranny of John; while John hoped (with
better reason as events proved) that the Pope’s friendship
would increase his ability to work his evil will upon
his enemies. In any case, no active opposition or protest
seems to have been raised by any one at the time of the
surrender. This step, so repugnant to later writers, seems
not to have been regarded by contemporaries as a disgrace.
Matthew Paris, indeed, writing in the next generation,
describes it as “a thing to be detested for all time”;
but then events had ripened in Matthew’s day, and he
was a keen politician rather than an impartial onlooker.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Stephen Langton, now assured of a welcome to the
high office into which he had been thrust against John’s
will, landed at Dover and was received by the King at
Winchester on 20th July, 1213. John swore on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Gospels to cherish and defend Holy Church, to restore
the good laws of Edward, and to render to all men their
rights, repeating practically the words of the coronation
oath. In addition, he promised to make reparation for
all property taken from the Church or churchmen. This
oath, with its accompanying promise, was the condition
on which he was to be absolved, provisionally by Langton,
and more formally by a legate, to be sent from Rome
specially for that purpose.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>V. The Years of Crisis, 1213–15.</h3>

<p class='c016'>For a brief season after John had made his peace
with Rome, he seemed to enjoy substantial fruits of
his diplomacy. Once more the short-sighted character
of his abilities was illustrated; a brief triumph led
to a deeper fall. The King for the moment considered,
with some show of reason, that he had regained the
mastery of his enemies at home and abroad. Philip’s
threatened invasion had to be abandoned; the people
renewed their allegiance on the removal of the papal
sentence; the barons had to reconcile themselves as best
they could, awaiting a better opportunity to rebel. If
John had confined himself to home affairs, he might have
postponed the final explosion: he could not, however,
reconcile himself to the loss of the great continental
heritage of his ancestors. His attempts to recover Normandy
and Anjou, partly by force of arms and partly
by a great coalition, led to new exactions and new murmurings,
while they ended in complete failure, which left
him, discredited and penniless, at the mercy of the
malcontents at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>His projected campaign in Poitou would require all
the levies he could raise. More than once John demanded,
and his barons refused, their feudal service.
Many excuses were put forward. At first they declined
to follow a King who had not yet been fully absolved. Yet
when Archbishop Stephen, on 20th July, 1213, removed
the papal censure from John at Winchester, after exacting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>promises of good government, the northern barons still
refused. Their new plea was that the tenure on which
they held their lands did not compel them to serve
abroad. They added that they were already exhausted
by expeditions within England.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John took this as open defiance, and determined, with
troops at his back (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per vim et arma</i></span>), to compel obedience.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before his preparations were completed, an important
assembly had met at St. Albans (on 4th August) to
make sworn inquest as to the extent of damage done to
churchmen during the years of John’s quarrel with
Rome. The meeting is notable, not merely because of
the reason of its summons, but also because of its composition.
It is the earliest national council in which
the principle of representation received recognition (so
far as our records go).<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c017'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Four lawful men, with the reeve,
from each village or manor on the royal demesne, were
present, but only, it must be remembered, in a very
mean capacity—only to make a sworn inquest as to the
amount of damage done. Such inquests by the humble
representatives of the villages were quite common locally;
the innovation lies in this, that their verdict was now
given in a national assembly. Directions were issued in
the King’s name from the same meeting, commanding
sheriffs, foresters, and others to observe the laws of
Henry I. and to abstain from unjust exactions, as they
valued their limbs and lives.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c017'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On 25th August, after John had set out with his
mercenaries to punish by force of arms the refusal of
his northern magnates to follow him to the Continent,
as he held them bound to do in terms of their feudal
obligations, Stephen Langton held a meeting with the
great men of the south. Many bishops, abbots, priors
and deans, together with some lay magnates of the
southern counties, met him at St. Paul’s, London. The
ostensible object of this assembly was to determine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>what use the Archbishop should make of his power to
grant partial relaxation of the interdict still casting its
blight over England—which could not be finally lifted
until the legate arrived with fuller powers. If we may
believe Roger of Wendover, more important business was
transacted in the King’s absence. Stephen reminded the
magnates that John’s absolution had been conditional on
a promise of good government, and as a standard to
guide them in judging what such government implied, he
produced a copy of Henry I.’s Charter of Liberties. All
present swore to “fight for those liberties, if it were
needful, even unto death.” The Archbishop promised his
help, “and a confederacy being thus made between them,
the conference was dissolved.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c017'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Stephen Langton, however, desired a peaceable solution
if possible, and three days later we find him, after a
somewhat hurried journey, at Northampton, on the 28th of
August, striving earnestly, and with success, to avert civil
war between John and the recalcitrant Crown tenants in
the north.</p>

<p class='c001'>His line of argument is worthy of especial note. The
King, he urged, must not levy war on his subjects before
he had obtained a legal judgment against them. The
substance of this advice should be compared with the
terms of chapter 39 of Magna Carta. John resented
the interference of Stephen in lay matters, and continued
his march to Nottingham; but threats of fresh excommunications
caused him at length to consent to substitute legal
process for violence, and to appoint a day for the trial
of the defaulters before the <cite>Curia Regis</cite>—a trial which
never took place.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c017'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John apparently continued his journey as far north
as Durham, but returned to meet the new papal legate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Nicholas, to whom he performed the promised homage and
repeated the formal act of surrender in St. Paul’s on
3rd October.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c017'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Having thus completed his alliance with
the Pope, he was confident of worsting his enemies in
France and England. As most, if not all, of the great
magnates were against him, he saw that it would be well
to strengthen his position by support of the class beneath
them in the feudal scheme of society. Perhaps it was this
that led John to broaden the basis of the national assembly.
The great Council which met at Oxford on 15th November,
1213, was made notable by the presence, in addition to
the Crown tenants, of representatives of the various
counties. The sheriffs, in the words of the King’s writs,
were to cause to assemble all knights already summoned
(that is, the Crown tenants) and four discreet men of
each county “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad loquendum nobiscum de negotiis regni nostri</i></span>.”
Miss Norgate<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c017'><sup>[17]</sup></a> lays stress on the fact that these writs were
issued after the death of the great Justiciar Geoffrey Fitz-Peter,
and before any successor had been appointed. John,
she argues, acted on his own initiative, and is thus
entitled to the credit of being the first statesman to
introduce representatives of the counties into the national
assembly. The importance of this precedent need not
be obscured by the selfish nature of the motives to
which it was due. Knights who were tenants of mesne
lords (Miss Norgate says “yeomen”) were invited to
act as a counterpoise to the barons. This innovation
anticipated the line of progress afterwards followed by
de Montfort and Edward I. Compared with it, the often-praised
provisions of chapter 14 of Magna Carta must
be regarded as antiquated and even reactionary.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the early spring of 1214, John considered his home
troubles ended, and that he was now free to use against
France the coalition formed by his diplomacy. He went
abroad early in February, leaving Peter des Roches,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the unpopular Bishop of Winchester, to keep the peace
as Justiciar, and to guard his interests, in concert with
the papal legate. Although deserted by the northern
barons, John relied partly on his mercenaries, but chiefly
on the Emperor Otto and his other powerful allies.
Fortune, always fickle, favoured him at first, only to
ruin all his schemes more completely in the end. The
crash came on Sunday, 27th July, 1214, when the King
of France triumphed over the allies at the decisive
battle of Bouvines. Three months later, John was
compelled to sign a five years’ truce with Philip,
abandoning all pretensions to recover his continental
dominions.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had left enemies at home more dangerous than those
who conquered him at Bouvines—enemies who had been
watching with trembling eagerness the vicissitudes of his
fortunes abroad. His earlier successes struck dismay into
the malcontents in England, apprehensive of the probable
sequel to his triumphant return home. They waited with
anxiety, but not in idleness, the culmination of his
campaign, wisely refraining from open rebellion until news
reached them of his failure or success. Meanwhile, they
quietly organized their programme of reform and their
measures of resistance. John’s strenuous endeavours to
exact money and service, while failing to fill his Exchequer
as he hoped, had ripened dormant hostility into an active
confederacy organized for resistance. When England
learned the result of the battle, the barons felt that the
moment for action had arrived.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even while abroad, John had not relaxed his efforts
to wring exactions from England. Without consent or
warning, he had imposed a scutage at the unprecedented
rate of three marks on the knight’s fee. Writs for
its collection had been issued on 26th May, 1214, an
exception being indeed allowed for tenants personally
present in the King’s army in Poitou. The northern
barons, who had already refused to serve in person, now
refused likewise to pay the scutage. This repudiation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>was couched in words particularly bold and sweeping;
they denied liability to follow the King not merely to
Poitou, but to any part of the Continent.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c017'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When John returned, in the middle of October, 1214,
he found himself confronted with a crisis unique in
English history. During his absence, the opponents of his
misrule had drawn together, formulated their grievances,
and matured their plans. The embarrassments on the
Continent which weakened the King, heartened the opposition.
The northern barons took the lead. Their cup of
wrath, which had long been filling, overflowed when the
scutage of three marks was imposed. Within a fortnight
of his landing, John held an interview with the malcontents
at Bury St. Edmunds (on 4th November, 1214).<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c017'><sup>[19]</sup></a> No
compromise was arrived at. John pressed for payment
of the scutage, and the barons refused.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems probable that, after John’s retiral, a conference
of a more private nature was held at which, under cloak
of attending the Abbey for prayer, a conspiracy against
John was sworn. Roger of Wendover gives a graphic
account of what happened. The magnates came together
“as if for prayers; but there was something else in the
matter, for after they had held much secret discourse,
there was brought forth in their midst the charter of
King Henry I., which the same barons had received
in London ... from Archbishop Stephen of Canterbury.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c017'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
A solemn oath was taken to withdraw their fealty (a
threat actually carried into effect on 5th May of the
following year), and to wage war on the King, unless he
granted their liberties; and a date—soon after Christmas—was
fixed for making their formal demands. Meanwhile
they separated to prepare for war. The King also
realized that a resort to arms was imminent. While
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>endeavouring to collect mercenaries, he tried unsuccessfully
to sow dissension among his opponents. In especial, he
hoped to buy off the hostility of the Church by a separate
charter which he issued on 21st November. This
professes to be granted “of the common consent of our
barons.” Its object was to gratify the Church by turning
canonical election from a sham into a reality. The election
of prelates, great and small, should henceforward be really
free in all cathedral and conventual churches and monasteries,
saving to the Crown the right of wardship during
vacancies. John promised never to deny or delay his
consent to an election, and conferred powers on the
electors, if he should do so, to proceed without him. The
King was bitterly disappointed in his hope that by this
bribe he would bring over the national Church from the
barons’ side to his own.</p>

<p class='c001'>John was probably well aware of what took place at St.
Edmunds after he had left, and he also knew that the close
of the year was the time fixed for the making of demands.
He held what must have been an anxious Christmas at
Worcester (always a favourite resting-place of this King),
but tarried only for a day, hastening to the Temple,
London, where the proximity of the Tower would give
him a feeling of security. There, on 6th January, 1215,
a deputation from the insurgents met him without disguising
that their demands were backed by force. These demands,
they told him, included the confirmation of the laws of
King Edward, with the liberties set forth in Henry’s
Charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the advice of the Archbishop and the Marshal, who
acted as mediators, John asked a truce till Easter, which
was granted in return for the promise that he would then
give reasonable satisfaction. The Archbishop, the Marshal,
and the Bishop of Ely were named as the King’s securities.</p>

<p class='c001'>On 15th January, John re-issued the Charter to the
Church, and demanded a renewal of homage from all his
subjects. The sheriffs in each county were instructed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>administer the oath in a specially stringent form; all
Englishmen must now swear to “stand by him against all
men.” Meanwhile emissaries were dispatched by both sides
to Rome. Eustace de Vesci, as spokesman of the malcontents,
asked Innocent, as overlord of England, to compel
John to restore the ancient liberties, and claimed consideration
on the ground that John’s surrender to the Pope had
been made under pressure put on the King by them—all
to no effect. John thought to propitiate the Pope by
taking the cross, a politic measure (the date of which is
given by one authority as 2nd February, and by another
as 4th March), which would also serve to protect him
against personal violence, and which afforded him, as is
well illustrated by several chapters of Magna Carta, a
fertile excuse for delay in remedying abuses. In April,
the northern barons, convinced that the moment for action
had arrived, met in arms at Stamford, and after Easter
(when the truce had expired) marched southward to Brackley,
in Northampton. There they were met, on 27th
April, by the Archbishop and the Marshal, as emissaries
from the King, who demanded what they wanted.
They received in reply, and took back with them to
John, a certain schedule, which consisted for the most
part of ancient laws and customs of the realm, with an
added threat that if the King did not immediately adhibit
his seal the rebels would constrain him by seizing his
castles, lands, and goods.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c017'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This schedule may be regarded as a rough draft of the
document more fully drawn out six weeks later, commonly
known as the Articles of the Barons.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c017'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John’s answer, when he read these demands, was emphatic.
“Why do not the barons, with these unjust
exactions, ask my kingdom?” Then furious, he declared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>with an oath that he would never grant them such
liberties, whereby he would make himself a slave.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c017'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On 5th May the barons formally renounced allegiance<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c017'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
and chose as commander, Robert Fitz-Walter, who styled
himself piously and grandiloquently, “Marshal of the army
of God and Holy Church.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The insurgents, still shivering on the brink of civil
war, delayed to march southwards. Much would depend
on the attitude of London, with its wealth and central
position; and John bade high for the support of its
citizens. On 9th May a new charter<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c017'><sup>[25]</sup></a> was granted
to the Londoners, who now received a long-coveted
privilege, the right to elect their mayor annually and
to remove him at the year’s end. This marked the
culmination of a long series of progressive grants in
their favour. Previously the mayor had held office for
life, and Henry Fitz-Aylwin, the earliest holder of the
office (appointed perhaps in 1191), had died in 1213.</p>

<p class='c001'>Apparently no price was paid for this charter; but
John doubtless expected in return the grateful support
of the Londoners, exactly as he had expected the support
of churchmen when he twice granted a charter in their
favour. In both instances he was disappointed. Next
day he made, probably as a measure of delay, an offer
of arbitration to the barons. In the full tide of military
preparations, he issued a writ in these words: "Know
that we have conceded to our barons who are against
us that we shall not take or disseise them or their
men, nor go against them <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per vim vel per arma</i></span>, unless
by the law of our land, or by the judgment of their
peers <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in curia nostra</i></span>, until consideration shall have been
made by four whom we shall choose on our part and
four whom they shall choose on their part, and the lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Pope who shall be oversman over them"—words worthy
of careful comparison with those used in chapter 39 of
Magna Carta. The offer could not be taken seriously,
since it left the decision of every vital issue virtually
to the Pope, whom the barons distrusted.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c017'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another royal writ, of two days later date, shows a
rapid change of policy, doubtless due to the contemptuous
rejection of arbitration. On 12th May, John ordered the
sheriffs to do precisely what he had offered not to do.
They were told to take violent measures against the
rebels without waiting for a “judgment of peers” or
other formality. Lands, goods, and chattels of the King’s
enemies were to be seized and applied to his benefit.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c017'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The barons, rejecting all offers, marched by Northampton,
Bedford, and Ware, towards the capital. London, in spite
of the charter received eight days earlier, boldly threw
in its lot with the insurgents, to whom it opened its
gates on 17th May.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c017'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The example of London was quickly
followed by other towns and by many hesitating nobles.
The confederates felt strong enough to issue letters to all
who still adhered to the King, bidding them forsake him
on pain of forfeiture.</p>

<p class='c001'>John found himself, for the moment, without power of
effective resistance; and, probably with the view of gaining
time rather than of committing himself irretrievably to any
abatement of his prerogatives, agreed to meet his opponents.
As a preliminary to this, on 8th June he issued a safe-conduct
for the barons’ representatives to meet him at
Staines within the three days following. This was apparently
too short notice, as on 10th June, John, now at
Windsor, granted an extension of the time and safe-conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>till Monday, 15th June. William the Marshal and other
envoys were dispatched from Windsor to the barons in
London with what was practically a message of surrender.
The barons were told that John “would freely accede to
the laws and liberties which they asked,” if they would
appoint a place and day for a meeting. The intermediaries,
in the words of Roger of Wendover,<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c017'><sup>[29]</sup></a> "without guile carried
back to the barons the message which had been guilefully
imposed on them"—implying that John meant to make no
promises, except such as were insincere. Yet the barons,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>immenso fluctuantes gaudio</i></span>, fixed as the time of meeting the
last day of the extended truce, Monday, 15th June, at a
certain meadow between Staines and Windsor, known as
Runnymede.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VI. Runnymede, and after.</h3>

<p class='c016'>On 15th June the King and the Barons met. On
the side of the insurgents appeared a great host; on the
monarch’s, merely a small band of magnates, loyal to the
person of the King, but only half-hearted, at the best, in
his support. Their names may be read in the preamble to
the Charter: the chief among them, Stephen Langton, still
nominally neutral, was known to be in full sympathy with
the rebels.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Stubbs,<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c017'><sup>[30]</sup></a> maintaining that the whole baronage of
England was implicated in these stirring events, gives a
masterly analysis of its more conspicuous members into
four great groups: (1) the Northumbrani or Norenses of
the chroniclers, names famous in the northern counties,
who had been the first to raise the standard of open
revolt, and retained the lead throughout; (2) the other
nobles from all parts of England, who had shown themselves
ready from an early date to co-operate with the
Northerners—“the great baronial families that had been
wise enough to cast away the feudal aspirations of their
forefathers, and the rising houses which had sprung
from the ministerial nobility”; (3) the moderate party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>who, ready to worship the rising sun, deserted John after
London had joined the rebels, including even the King’s
half-brother (the Earl of Salisbury), the loyal Marshal,
Hubert de Burgh, and other ministers of the Crown, whose
names may be read in the preamble to the Charter; and
(4) the tools of John’s misgovernment, mostly men of
foreign birth, tied to John by motives of interest as well
as by personal loyalty, since their differences with the
baronial leaders lay too deep for reconciliation, most of
whom are branded by name in Magna Carta as for ever
incapable of holding office in the realm. These men
of desperate fortunes alone remained whole-hearted on
John’s side when the crisis came.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c017'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When the conference began, the fourth group was not
near John, being otherwise occupied in the command of
castle garrisons or of troops actually in the field; the third
group, a small one, was with him; and the first and second
groups were, in their imposing strength, arrayed against
him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately, the vagueness of contemporary accounts
prevents us from reproducing with certainty the progress
of negotiations on that eventful 15th of June and the
few days following. Some inferences, however, may be
drawn from the words of the completed Charter itself and
from those of several closely related documents. One of
these, the Articles of the Barons,<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c017'><sup>[32]</sup></a> is sometimes supposed
to be identical in its terms with the Schedule which had
been already presented to the King’s emissaries, at Brackley,
on the 27th of April.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c017'><sup>[33]</sup></a> It is more probable, however, that
during the seven eventful weeks which had since elapsed,
the original demands had been somewhat modified. It is
not unlikely that the interval had been employed in making
the terms of the suggested agreement more full and specific.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>The Schedule of April was probably only a rough draft
of the Articles as we know them, and these formed in
their turn the new draft on which the completed Charter
was based. Articles and Charter are alike authenticated
with the impress of the King’s great seal, an indisputable
proof that the terms of each of them actually received his
official consent.</p>

<p class='c001'>This fact affords a strong presumption that an interval
must have elapsed between the King’s acceptance of the
first and the final completion of the second; since it would
have been absurd to seal what was practically a draft
at the same time as the principal instrument. The probability
of such an interval must not be lost sight of in
any attempt to reconstruct in chronological sequence the
stages of the negotiations at Runnymede.</p>

<p class='c001'>A few undoubted facts form a starting-point on which
inferences may be based. John’s headquarters were fixed
at Windsor from Monday, 15th June, to the afternoon of
Tuesday the 23rd. On each of these nine days (with
the possible exception of the 16th and 17th) he visited
Runnymede to confer with the barons.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c017'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Two crucial stages in these negotiations were clearly
reached on Monday the 15th (the date borne by Magna
Carta itself) and on Friday the 19th (the day on which
John in more than one writ stated that peace had been
concluded). What happened exactly on each of these two
days is, however, to some extent, matter of conjecture.
It is here maintained, with some confidence, that on Monday
the substance of the barons’ demands was provisionally
accepted and that the Articles were then sealed; while on
Friday this arrangement was finally confirmed and Magna
Carta itself, in several duplicates, was sealed.</p>

<p class='c001'>To justify these inferences, a more detailed examination
of the evidence available will be necessary. The earliest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>meeting between John and the baronial leaders, all authorities
are agreed, took place on Monday, 15th June, probably
in the early morning. The barons undoubtedly came to
the conference provided with an accurate list of those
grievances which they were determined to have redressed.
On the previous 27th of April the rebels had sent a
written Schedule to the King, along with a demand that he
should signify his acceptance by affixing his seal;<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c017'><sup>[35]</sup></a> they are
not likely to have been less fully prepared on 15th June.</p>

<p class='c001'>John, on his part, would naturally try a policy of
evasions and delays; and, when these were clearly useless,
would then endeavour to secure modifications of the
terms offered. These tactics met with no success. His
opponents demanded a plain acceptance of their plainly
expressed demands. Before nightfall, John, overawed by
their firmness and by the numbers of the armed force
behind them, was constrained to surrender. Leaving
minor points of detail to be subsequently adjusted, he
provisionally accepted the substance of the long list of
reforms put before him by the barons, on the understanding
that they would renew their allegiance and give
him some security that they would keep the peace. In
proof of this bargain, the heads of the agreement were
rapidly engrossed on parchment to the number of forty-nine,
and the great seal was impressed on the wax of
the label, where it may still be seen.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c017'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The parchment containing these Articles of the Barons
may have been the identical Schedule actually prepared
by the rebel leaders previous to the meeting; but, more
probably, it was written out at Runnymede during the
conference on the 15th (or between two conferences on
that day) by one of the clerks of the royal Chancery.
This is more in keeping with its heading (written in
the same hand, and apparently at the same time as the
body of the deed), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ista sunt capitula quae barones petunt
et dominus rex concedit</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Likely enough, it followed closely the words of the
baronial Schedule; but it may have contained some slight
modifications in favour of the Crown. One such, at least,
was inserted, apparently as an afterthought (on the intervention
of the King perhaps, or one of his friends); articles
45 and 46, as originally conceived, have been subsequently
connected by a rude bracket, and a qualifying proviso added
which practically bestowed on the Archbishop the powers
of an arbitrator to determine whether both articles should
be altered in favour of the Crown or no.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c017'><sup>[37]</sup></a> The entire
document is in a running hand, and appears to have been
rapidly though carefully written. Its engrossment upon
parchment with a quill pen must have occupied several
hours; but a diligent copyist would not find it beyond
his powers to complete the task in one day.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday were consumed in
further negotiations as to matters of detail; in reducing
the heads of agreement already accepted to the more
binding form of a feudal charter; and in engrossing
several copies for greater security. Everything was,
however, ready for a final settlement on Friday the 19th.
At the conference held on that day the conclusion of
the final concord probably included several steps; among
others, the nomination by the opposition, with the King’s
tacit acquiescence, of twenty-five barons to act as Executors
under chapter 61,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c017'><sup>[38]</sup></a> the solemn sealing and delivery
of several original copies of the Great Charter in its
final form, the taking of an oath by all parties to abide
by its provisions, and the issue of the first batch of writs
of instructions to the sheriffs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Blackstone<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c017'><sup>[39]</sup></a> thinks that the barons on that day renewed
their oaths of fealty and homage. It is more probable
that, until John had actually carried out the more pressing
reforms promised in Magna Carta, they refused formally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>to swear allegiance, undertaking, however, in the hearing
of the two archbishops and other prelates, that they would
keep the peace and furnish security to that effect in any
form that John might name, except only by delivery of
their castles or of hostages.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c017'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The statement that Friday, 19th June, was the day on
which peace was finally concluded rests on unmistakable evidence.
On 21st June, John wrote from Windsor to William
of Cantilupe, one of his captains, instructing him not to
enforce payment of any unpaid balances of “tenseries”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c017'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
demanded since the preceding Friday, “on which day peace
was made between the King and his barons.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c017'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It has been taken for granted by many historians that
the peace was finally concluded, and the Great Charter
actually sealed and issued on the 15th, not on the 19th.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c017'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
The fact that all four copies of Magna Carta still extant
bear this date seems to have been regarded as absolutely
conclusive on this point. Experts in diplomatics, however,
have long been aware that elaborate charters
and other documents, which occupied a considerable time
in preparation, usually bore the date, not of their actual
execution, but of the day on which were concluded the
transactions of which they form the record. Legal instruments
were thus commonly ante-dated (as it would be
reckoned according to modern legal practice). Thus it is
far from safe to infer from Magna Carta’s mention of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>its own date that the great seal was actually adhibited on
the 15th June.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such presumption as exists points the other way. The
Great Charter is a lengthy and elaborate document, and it
is barely possible that any one of the four originals known
to us could have been engrossed (to say nothing of the
adjustment of the substance and form) within one day.
Not only is it much longer than the Articles on which it is
founded; but even the most casual comparison will convince
any unbiassed mind of the slower rate of engrossment of the
Charter. All four copies show marks of great deliberation,
while those at Lincoln and Salisbury in particular are
exquisite models of leisurely and elaborate penmanship.
The highly finished initial letters of the first line and
other ornamental features may be instructively compared
with the plain, business-like, rapid hand of the
Articles. How many additional copies now lost were once
in existence bearing the same date, it is impossible to say;
but each of those still extant may well have occupied four
days in the writing.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c017'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>A comparison between the two documents shows few
changes of importance in the tenor.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c017'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The one outstanding addition is the insertion, in an
emphatic form, both at the beginning and at the end of the
Charter, of a general declaration in favour of the freedom
and rights of the Church. The inference seems to be that
a new influence was brought to bear, between the preparation
of the draft and that of the Charter. It was the
Archbishop of Canterbury and his friends who thus converted
the original baronial manifesto into something more
nearly resembling a declaration of rights for the nation
at large. One or two minor alterations seem slightly to
benefit the Crown,<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c017'><sup>[46]</sup></a> while several others, rightly viewed,
suggest an influence at work unfavourable to the towns
and trading classes.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c017'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to the various originals of the Charter issued
under the great seal, chapter 62 provides that authenticated
copies should be made and certified as correct by “Letters
Testimonial,” under the seals of the two archbishops with
the legate and the bishops. This was done, but the exact
date of their issue is unknown.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c017'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The same Friday which thus saw the completion of negotiations
saw also the issue of the first batch of letters of
instructions to the various sheriffs, telling them that a firm
peace had been concluded, by God’s grace, between John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>and the barons and freemen of the kingdom, as they might
hear and see by the Charter which had been made, and
which was to be published throughout the district, and firmly
observed. Each sheriff was further commanded to cause all
in his bailiwick to make oath according to the form of the
Charter to the twenty-five barons or their attorneys, and
further, to see to the appointment of twelve knights of the
county in full County Court, in order that they might
declare upon oath all evil customs requiring to be reformed,
as well of sheriffs as of their servants, foresters, and others.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c017'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
This was held to apply chiefly to the redress of forest
grievances.</p>

<p class='c001'>Apparently, four days elapsed before similar letters, accompanied
by copies of the Charter, could be sent to every
sheriff. During the same few days, several writs (some of
which have already been mentioned) were dispatched to military
commanders with orders to stop hostilities. A few writs,
dated mostly 25th June, show that some obnoxious sheriffs
had been removed to make way for better men. Hubert
de Burgh, a moderate though loyal adherent, and a man
generally respected, was appointed Justiciar in room of
the hated Peter des Roches. On 27th June, another writ
directed the sheriffs and the elected knights to punish, by
forfeiture of lands and chattels, all those who refused to
swear to the twenty-five Executors within a fortnight. All
these various instructions may be regarded as forming part
of the settlement of the 19th of June, and were dispatched
with the greatest rapidity possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even after the settlement arrived at on Friday, some
minor points of dispute remained. The barons refused to
be satisfied without substantial security that the reforms
and restorations agreed on would be carried out by the
King; they demanded that both the city of London and
the Tower of London should be left completely under their
control as pledges of John’s good faith, until 15th August,
or longer, if the reforms had not then been completed.
John obtained a slight modification of these demands; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>surrendered the city of London to his opponents, as they
asked; but placed the Tower in the neutral custody of
the Archbishop of Canterbury. These conditions were
embodied in a supplementary treaty, which describes itself
as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Conventio facta inter Regem Angliae et barones ejusdem
regni</i></span>.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c017'><sup>[50]</sup></a> If the barons distrusted John, he was equally
distrustful of them, demanding the security they had promised
for fulfilment of their part of the original compact.
He now asked a formal charter in his favour that they
would observe the peace and their oaths of homage, which
they point-blank refused to grant. The King appealed to
the prelates without effect. The archbishops, with several
suffragans, however, put a formal protest on record of the
barons’ promise and subsequent refusal to keep it.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c017'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The two archbishops and their brother prelates entered
a second protest of a different nature. They seem to have
become alarmed by the drastic measures adopted or likely
to be adopted, founded on the verdicts of the twelve
knights elected in each county to carry into effect the
various clauses of the Great Charter directed against abuses
of the Forest laws. Apparently, it was feared that reforms
of a sweeping nature would result, and practically
abolish the royal forests altogether. Accordingly, they
placed their protest formally on record—acting undoubtedly
in the interests of the Crown, feeling that as mediators
they were bound in some measure to see fairplay. They
objected to a strained construction of the words of the
Charter, holding that the articles in question ought to be
understood as limited; all customs necessary for the preservation
of the forests should remain in force.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c017'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The provisions referred to were, as is now well known,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>chapters 47, 48, and 53 of Magna Carta itself, and not,
as Roger of Wendover states, a separate Forest Charter.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c017'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
That writer was led into this unfortunate error by confusing
the charter granted by King John with its re-issue
by his son in 1217, when provisions for the reform of the
forest law <em>were</em> framed into a separate supplementary
charter. From Roger’s time onwards, the charters of
Henry III. were reproduced in all texts and treatises, in
place of the real charter actually granted by John. Sir
William Blackstone was the first commentator to discover
this grievous error, and he clearly emphasized the grave
differences between the terms granted by John and those
of his son, showing in particular that the former king
granted no separate Forest Charter at all.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c017'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Before the conferences at Runnymede came to an end,
confidence in the good intentions of the twenty-five Executors,
drawn it must be remembered entirely from the
section of the baronage most extreme in their views and
most unfriendly to John, seems to have been completely
lost. If we may believe Matthew Paris,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c017'><sup>[55]</sup></a> a second body
or committee of thirty-eight barons was nominated, representing
other and more moderate sections of the baronage,
to act as a check on the otherwise all-powerful
oligarchy of twenty-five despots. If this second committee
was ever really appointed, no details have been preserved
as to the date of its selection, or as to the exact powers
entrusted to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the rebel leaders expected to arrive at a permanent
settlement of their disputes when they came to meet the
King on the morning of the 15th day of June, it must
have been evident to all before the 23rd, that John only
made the bargain in order to gain time and strength to
break it. Three weeks, indeed, before John granted Magna
Carta, he had begun his preparations for its repudiation.
In a letter of 29th May, addressed to the Pope, there
may still be read his own explanation of the causes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>quarrel, and how he urged, with the low cunning peculiar
to him, that the hostility of the rebels prevented the
fulfilment of his vow of crusade. In conclusion, he expressed
his willingness to abide by the Pope’s decision
on all matters at issue.</p>

<p class='c001'>John, then, at Runnymede was merely waiting for two
events which would put him in a position to throw off
the mask—the favourable answer he confidently expected
from the Pope, and the arrival of foreign troops. Meanwhile,
delay was doubly in his favour; since the combination
formed against him was certain, in a short time, to
break up. It was, in the happy phrase of Dr. Stubbs,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c017'><sup>[56]</sup></a>
a mere “coalition,” not an "organic union"—a coalition,
too, in momentary danger of dissolving into its original
factors. The barons were without sufficient sinews of war
to carry a protracted struggle to a successful issue. Very
soon, both sides to the treaty of peace were preparing for war.
The northern barons, anticipating the King in direct breach
of the compact, began to fortify their castles. John, in
equally bad faith, wrote for foreign allies, whilst he
anxiously awaited the Pope’s answer to his appeal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Langton and the bishops still struggled to restore harmony.
The 16th July was fixed for a new conference.
John did not attend; but it was probably at this Council
that in his absence a papal bull was read conferring upon
a commission of three—the Bishop of Winchester, the
Abbot of Reading, and the legate Pandulf—full powers to
excommunicate all “disturbers of the King and Kingdom.”
No names were mentioned, but these powers might clearly
be used against Langton and his friends. The execution of
this sentence was delayed, in the groundless hope of a
compromise, till the middle of September, when two of
the commissioners, Pandulf and Peter of Winchester, demanded
that the Archbishop should publish it; and, on
his refusal, they forthwith, in terms of their papal authority,
suspended him from his office. Stephen left for Rome,
and his absence at a critical juncture proved a national
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>misfortune. The insurgents lost in him, not only their
bond of union, but also a wholesome restraint. His absence
must be reckoned among the causes of the royalist reaction
soon to take place. After his departure, a papal bull
arrived (in the end of September) dated 24th August.
This is an important document in which Innocent, in the
plainest terms, annuls and abrogates the Charter, after
adopting all the facts and reproducing all the arguments
furnished by the King. Beginning with a full description
of John’s wickedness and repentance, his surrender of
England and Ireland, his acceptance of the Cross, his
quarrel with the barons; it goes on to describe Magna
Carta as the result of a conspiracy, and concludes, “We
utterly reprobate and condemn any agreement of this kind,
forbidding, under ban of our anathema, the aforesaid king
to presume to observe it, and the barons and their accomplices
to exact its performance, declaring void and entirely
abolishing both the Charter itself and the obligations and
safeguards made, either for its enforcement or in accordance
with it, so that they shall have no validity at any time
whatsoever.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c017'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A supplementary bull, of one day’s later date, reminded
the barons that the suzerainty of England belonged to
Rome, and that therefore nothing could be done in the
kingdom without papal consent.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c017'><sup>[58]</sup></a> Thereafter, at a Lateran
Council, Innocent formally excommunicated the English
barons who had persecuted “John, King of England,
crusader and vassal of the Church of Rome, by endeavouring
to take from him his kingdom, a fief of the Holy
See.”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c017'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, the points in dispute had been submitted to
the rude arbitrament of civil war, in which the first notable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>success fell to King John in the capture, by assault, of
Rochester Castle on 30th November. The barons had
already made overtures to Louis, the French King’s son,
to whom they promised as a reward for his help, yet
not perhaps with entire sincerity, the crown of England.
Towards the end of November, some seven thousand French
troops arrived in London, where they spent the winter—a
winter consumed by John in marching from place to
place meeting, on the whole, with success, especially in the
east of England. John’s best ally was the Pope, who had
no intention of allowing a French Prince to usurp the
throne of one who was now his humble vassal. Gualo
was dispatched from Rome to Philip, King of France,
forbidding his son’s invasion, and asking rather protection
and assistance for John as a papal vassal. Philip, anxious
to meet the force of the Pope’s arguments with some title
to intervene, of more weight than the invitation of a group
of rebels, replied by an ingenious string of fictions. He
endeavoured to find defects in John’s title as King of
England, and to argue that therefore John was not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in
titulo</i></span> to grant to the Pope the rights of an overlord.
Among other arguments it was urged that John had
been convicted of treason while Richard was King, and
that this sentence involved forfeiture by the traitor of all
rights of succession to the Crown. Thus the Pope’s claim
of intervention was invalid, while Prince Louis justified
his own interference by some imagined right which he
ingeniously argued had passed to him through the mother
of his wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>John had not relied solely on papal protection. A great
fleet, collected at Dover to block Louis with his smaller
vessels in Calais harbour, was wrecked on 18th May, 1216.
The channel thus cleared of English ships, the French Prince,
setting sail on the night of the 20th May, landed next
morning without opposition. John, reduced to dependence
on mercenaries, did not dare oppose his landing. Gualo,
now in England, on 28th May excommunicated Louis by
name, and laid London under interdict. Such thunderbolts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>had now lost their blasting power by frequent repetition,
and produced no effect whatever. On 2nd June, Louis
entered London amid acclamations, and marched against
John at Winchester, which he reached on 14th June, after
John had fled. Ten days later, the ancient capital of Wessex
with its castles surrendered. Next day, the French Prince
attacked Dover, whose brave defender, Hubert de Burgh,
after some months of stubborn resistance, obtained a truce,
on 14th October, in order that the garrison might communicate
with the King. Before Hubert’s messengers
could reach him, John was dying. During these months,
when the verdict of war was going against him in the
south, he had been acting in the north strenuously, and
not without success. The issue still trembled in the balance.
A royalist reaction had begun. The insolence of the French
troops caused desertions from the barons.</p>

<p class='c001'>On 10th October John, after being feasted to excess
by the loyal burghers of Lynn, fell into an illness from
which he never really recovered. Nine days later, worn out
by his wars, and by excitement and chagrin, at this critical
juncture when fortune might have taken any sudden turn,
he died at Newark Castle, in the early hours of the morning
of 19th October, 1216. His death saved the situation,
rendering a compromise possible. Almost immediately,
there took place an entirely new grouping of political
forces inside and outside of England. A silent compromise
was effected, all parties returning gradually to their natural
allegiance to the son of John, on the understanding that
the Charter in its main features should be accepted as
the basis of his government. Prince Louis was soon
discarded. Rome also fell into line; the death of Innocent,
on 16th June, 1216, had been equally opportune with the
death of John, four months later, removing an obstacle
from the path of peace. Gualo, in the name of Innocent’s
successor, consented to the re-issue of the Charter by the
advisers of the young King Henry.</p>

is undoubtedly an error in the copy of a writ by King John appearing on the
<cite>Patent Rolls</cite>. This writ, which as copied in the <cite>Rolls</cite> bears to be dated 18th
June (erroneously as will immediately be shown), is addressed to Stephen
Harengod (in terms closely resembling those of the writ already cited from
the <cite>Close Rolls</cite> addressed to William of Cantilupe), announcing <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inter alia</i></span>
that terms of peace had been agreed upon “last Friday.” Miss Norgate
contends with reason that there must be a mistake somewhere, since on
the Friday preceding the 18th, negotiations had not even begun. She is
confident that "the ‘die Veneris’ which occurs three times in the writ is in
each case an unquestionable, though unaccountable, error for ‘die Lunae.’"
Yet, it is unlikely that a scribe writing three days after so momentous an
event could have mistaken the day of the week. It is infinitely more probable
that in writing xxiij. he formed the second “x” so carelessly that it
was mistaken by the enrolling clerk for a “v.” The correct date is thus
the 23rd, and the reference is to Friday the 19th. This presumption
becomes a certainty by comparison with the words of the writ to William
of Cantilupe, dated the 21st (of the existence of which Miss Norgate was
probably not aware).</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>PART II. <br /> FEUDAL GRIEVANCES AND MAGNA CARTA.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'>I. The Immediate Causes of the Crisis.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Many attempts have been made to explain why the
storm, long brewing, broke at last in 1214, and culminated
precisely in June of the following year. Sir
William Blackstone<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c017'><sup>[60]</sup></a> shows how carefully historians have
sought for some one specific feature or event, occurring
in these years, of such moment as by itself to account
for the rebellion crowned for the moment with success
at Runnymede. Thus Matthew Paris, he tells us, attributes
the whole movement to the sudden discovery of Henry I.’s
charter, long forgotten as he supposes, while other
chroniclers agree in assigning John’s inordinate debauchery
as the cause of the civil dissensions, dwelling on his
personal misdeeds, real and imaginary. “Sordida foedatur
foedante Johanne, gehenna.”<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c017'><sup>[61]</sup></a> Blackstone himself suggests
a third event, the appointment as Regent in John’s absence
of the hated alien and upstart, Peter des Roches, and his
misconduct in that office.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is absolutely no necessity to seek in such
trivial causes the explanation of a great movement,
really inevitable, the antecedents of which were deeply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>rooted in the past. The very success of Henry Plantagenet
in performing the great task of restoring order in
England, for effecting which special powers had been
allowed to him, made the continuance of these powers to
his successors unnecessary. From the day of Henry’s
death, if not earlier, forces were at work which only required
to be combined in order to control the licence of
the Crown. When the battle of order had been finally
won—the complete overthrow of the rebellion of 1173
may be taken as a crucial date in this connection—the
battle of liberty had, almost necessarily, to be begun.
The clamant problem of the hour was no longer how to
prop up the weakness of the Crown; but rather how
to place restrictions on its unbridled strength.</p>

<p class='c001'>We need not wonder that the crisis came at last, but
rather why it was so long delayed. Events, however,
were not ripe for rebellion before John’s accession, and
a favourable occasion did not occur previous to 1215.
The doctrine of momentum accounts in politics for the long
continuance of old institutions in a condition even of
unstable equilibrium; an entirely rotten system of government
may remain for ages until at the destined moment
comes the final shock. John conferred a great boon on
future generations, when by his arrogance and by his misfortunes
he combined against him all classes and interests
in the community.</p>

<p class='c001'>The chief factor in the coalition which ultimately
triumphed over John was undoubtedly the baronial party
led by those strenuous nobles of the north, who were,
beyond doubt, goaded into active opposition by their own
personal and class wrongs, not by any altruistic promptings
to sacrifice themselves for the common good. Their
complaints, too, as they appear reflected in the imperishable
record of Magna Carta, are mainly grounded on
breaches of the technical rules of feudal usage, not upon
the broad basis of constitutional principle.</p>

<p class='c001'>The feudal grievances most bitterly resented may
be ranged under one or other of two heads—increase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>in the weight of feudal obligations and infringement, of
feudal jurisdictions. The Crown, while it exacted from
its tenants the fullest measure of services legally exigible,
interfered persistently at the same time with those rights
and privileges which had originally balanced the obligations.
The barons were compelled to give more, while
they received less.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the first group of baronial grievances posterity
can sympathize in a whole-hearted way, since the increase
of feudal obligations inflicted undoubted hardships on the
Crown tenants, while the redress of these involved
no real danger to constitutional progress. One and all
of the grievances included in this first group could be
condemned (as they were condemned by various chapters
of Magna Carta) without unduly reducing the efficiency
of the monarchy which still formed under John, as it
had done under William I., the sole source of security
against the dangers of feudal anarchy. Posterity, however,
cannot equally sympathize with the efforts of the barons
to redress their second class of wrongs. However great
may have been the immediate hardships inflicted on members
of the aristocracy by the suppression of their
feudal courts, lovers of constitutional progress can only
rejoice that all efforts to restore them failed. Those
clauses of Magna Carta which aimed at reversing the
great currents flowing towards royal justice, and away
from private baronial justice, produced no permanent
effect, and posterity has had reason to rejoice in their
failure.</p>

<p class='c001'>Each group of feudal grievances—those connected with
the increase of feudal obligations, and those connected
with the curtailment of feudal immunities—requires special
and detailed treatment.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c017'><sup>[62]</sup></a> To each class a double interest
attaches, since the resentment aroused by both formed so
vital an element in the spread of that spirit of determined
resistance to King John, which led to the winning
of Magna Carta, and since, further, an intimate knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of the exact nature of these grievances throws a flood of
light on many otherwise obscure clauses of the Great
Charter, and enables us to estimate how far the promised
remedies were ultimately carried into practice in later
reigns.</p>

<p class='c001'>The grievances of the barons, many and varied as
they were, were not, however, the only wrongs calling
for redress. It is probable that the baronial party, if
they had acted in isolation from the other estates of the
realm, would have failed in 1215 as they had already
failed in 1173. If the Crown had retained the active
sympathy of Church and common people, John might
have successfully defied the baronage as his father had
done before him. He had, on the contrary, alienated
from the monarchy all estates and interests, and had
broadened the basis of opposition to the throne by ill-treating
the mercantile classes and the peasantry who,
from the reign of William I. to that of Henry II., had
remained the fast, if humble, friends of the Crown. The
order-loving tradesmen of the towns had been previously
willing to purchase protection from Henry at the price
of heavy, even crushing taxation; but when John continued
to exact the price, and yet failed to furnish good
government in return, his hold on the nation was completely
lost. So far from protecting the humble from
oppression, he was himself the chief central oppressor,
and he let loose, besides, his foreign officers and favourites
as petty local oppressors in all the numerous offices of
sheriff, castellan, and bailiff. Far from using the perfected
machinery of Exchequer, Curia, and local administration
in the interests of good government, John valued
them merely as instruments of extortion and outrage—as
ministers to his lust and greed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lower orders were by no means exempt from the
increased taxation which proved so galling to the feudal
tenants. When John, during his quarrel with Rome,
repaid each new anathema of the Pope by fresh acts of
spoliation against the national Church, the sufferings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the clergy were shared by the poor. In confiscating the
goods of the monasteries, he destroyed the chief provision
for poor-relief known to the thirteenth century. The
alienation of the affections of the great masses of lower-class
Englishmen thus effected was never wholly undone,
even by the reconciliation of John with the Pope.
Notwithstanding the completeness and even abjectness
of John’s surrender to Rome, he took no special pains to
reinstate himself in the good graces of the Church at
home. Innocent, secure at the Lateran, had issued his
thunderbolts; and John’s counter-strokes had fallen, not
on him, but on the English clergy—from the prelate to
the parish priest, from the abbot to the humblest monk.
The measures taken, in 1213 and afterwards, to make
good to these victims some part of the heavy losses
sustained, were quite inadequate. The interests of the
Church universal were often widely different from those of
the national Church, and such diversity was never more
clearly marked than in the last years of the reign of John.</p>

<p class='c001'>After 1213, John’s alliance with Rome brought new
dangers in its train. The united action of two tyrants,
each claiming supreme powers, lay and spiritual respectively,
threatened to exterminate the freedom of the
English nation and the English Church. “The country
saw that the submission of John to Innocent placed its
liberty, temporally and spiritually, at his mercy; and
immediately demanded safeguards.”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c017'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This union of tyrants naturally led to another union
which checkmated it, for the baronial opposition allied
itself with the ecclesiastical opposition. The urgency of
their common need thus brought prelates and barons
into line—for the moment. The necessary leader was
found in Stephen Langton, who succeeded in preventing
the somewhat divergent interests of the two estates from
leading them in opposite directions.</p>

<p class='c001'>All things were thus ripe for rebellion, and even for
<em>united</em> rebellion; an opportunity only was required. Such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>an opportunity came in a tempting form in 1214; for
the King had then lost prestige and power by his failure
in the wars with France. He had lost the confidence of
his subjects by his quarrel with Rome, and he failed to
regain it by his reconciliation. He had lost the friendship
of the national Church. His unpopularity and vacillating
nature had been thoroughly demonstrated. Finally he had
himself, in 1191, when plotting against his absent brother
Richard, successfully attacked and ousted the Regent
Longchamp from office, thus furnishing an example of
rebellion, and of successfully concerted action against the
central government.</p>

<p class='c001'>The result was that, when the barons—the wildest spirits
of the northern counties taking always the lead—began
active operations at a juncture of John’s fortunes most
favourable to their aspirations, not only had they no
opposition to dread from churchman or merchant, from
yeoman or peasant, but they might count on the sympathy
of all and the active co-operation of many. Further,
John’s policy of misrule had combined against him two
interests usually opposed to each other, the party of
progress and the party of reaction. The influence of each
of these may be clearly read in the various chapters of
Magna Carta.</p>

<p class='c001'>The progressive party consisted mainly of the heads
of the more recently created baronial houses, men trained
in the administrative methods of Henry II., who desired
merely that the system of government they knew should
be properly enforced and carried out to its logical conclusions.
They demanded chiefly that the King should
conduct the business of the Exchequer and Curia according
to the rules laid down by Henry II. Routine and order
under the new system were what this party desired, and
not a return to the unruly days of Stephen. Many of the
innovations of the great Angevin had now been loyally
and finally accepted by all classes of the nation; and these
accordingly found a permanent resting-place in the provisions
of the Great Charter. In temporary co-operation with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>this party, the usually rival party of reaction was willing
to act for the moment against the common enemy. There
still existed in John’s reign magnates of the old feudal
school, who hoped to wrest from the weakened hand of
the King some measure of feudal independence. They had
indeed accepted such reforms as suited them, but still
bitterly opposed many others. In particular, they resisted
the encroachments of the royal courts of law which were
gradually superseding their private jurisdictions. For the
moment, John’s crafty policy, so well devised to gain
immediate ends, and so unwise in the light of subsequent
history, combined these two streams, usually ready to
thwart each other, into a united opposition to his throne.
Attacked at the same moment by the votaries of traditional
usage and by the votaries of reform, by the
barons, the trading classes, and the clergy, no course was
left him but to surrender at discretion. The movement
which culminated at Runnymede may thus best be understood
as the resultant of a number of different but converging
forces, some of which were progressive and some
reactionary.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>II. The Crown and Feudal Obligations.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Among the many evils calling loudly for redress in England
at the commencement of the thirteenth century, none
spoke with more insistent voice than those connected
with feudal abuses. The objection of the northern
barons to pay the scutage demanded on 26th May, 1214,
was the spark that fired the mine. The most prominent
feature of the Charter is the solicitude everywhere displayed
to define the exact extent of feudal services and
dues, and to prevent these from being arbitrarily increased.
A somewhat detailed knowledge of feudalism and feudal
obligations forms a necessary preliminary to any exact
study of Magna Carta.</p>

<p class='c001'>The precise relations of the Norman Conquest to the
growth of feudalism in England are complicated, and have
formed the subject of much controversy. The view now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>generally accepted, and with reason, is that the policy of
William the Conqueror accelerated the process in one
direction, but retarded it in another. Feudalism, regarded
as a system of government, had its worst tendencies checked,
if not eradicated, by the great upheaval that followed the
coming of Duke William; feudalism, considered as a system
of land tenure, and as a social system, was, on the contrary,
formulated and developed. It is mainly as a system of land
tenure that it falls here to be considered. Originally, the
relationship between lord and tenant, dependent upon the
double ownership of land (of which each was, in a different
sense, the proprietor), implied obligations on both sides.
The lord gave protection, while the tenant owed services of
various sorts. It so happened, however, that, with the
changes wrought by time, the legal obligations of the lord
ceased to be of much importance, while those of the vassal
became more and more burdensome. The tenant’s obligations
varied in kind and in extent with the nature of the
tenure. It is difficult to frame an exact list of the various
tenures formerly recognized as distinct in English law:
partly because the classical authors of different epochs, from
Bracton to Blackstone, contradict each other; and partly
because of the obscurity of the process by which these
tenures were gradually differentiated. The word “tenure”
originally meant “a holding” of any sort. Sir William
Blackstone,<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c017'><sup>[64]</sup></a> after explaining the dependent nature of all
real property in England, thus proceeds: “The thing holden
is therefore styled a <em>tenement</em>, the possessors thereof <em>tenants</em>,
and the manner of their possession a <em>tenure</em>.” Tenure thus
comes to mean the conditions on which a tenant holds real
estate under his lord, and the number of tenures varies
with the number of accepted types.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ancient classification differs materially from that in
use at the present day. The modern English lawyer (unless
of an antiquarian turn of mind) concerns himself only with
three tenures: freehold (now practically identical with
socage), copyhold and <a id='corr65.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='leasehold'>leasehold.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_65.37'><ins class='correction' title='leasehold'>leasehold.</ins></a></span> The two last-mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>may be rapidly dismissed, as they were of little importance
in the eyes of Littleton, or of Coke: leasehold embraces
only temporary interests, such as those of a tenant-at-will
or for a limited term of years; while copyhold is the
modern form of tenure into which the old unfree villeinage
has slowly ripened. The ancient writers were, on the
contrary, chiefly concerned with holdings both permanent
and free (as opposed to leaseholds on the one hand and
villeinage on the other). Of such free tenures seven at
least may be distinguished in the thirteenth century, all
of which have now come to be represented by the same
one of the three recognized modern tenures, namely, freehold
or socage. The free holdings existing in medieval
England may be ranged under the following heads, viz.:
knight’s service, free socage, fee-farm, frankalmoin, grand
serjeanty, petty serjeanty, and burgage.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <em>Knight’s Service.</em> Medieval feudalism had many
aspects; it was almost as essentially an engine of war as
it was a system of land-holding. The normal return for
which an estate was granted consisted of the service in
the field of a specific number of knights. Thus the normal
feudal holding was known as knight’s service, or tenure
in chivalry—the conditions of which must be constantly
kept in view, since by these rules the relations between
John and his recalcitrant vassals fell to be determined.
When finally abolished at the Restoration, there fell with
knight’s service, it is not too much to say, the feudal
system of land tenure in England. “Tenure by barony”
is sometimes spoken of as a separate species, but may be
more correctly viewed as a variety of tenure in chivalry.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c017'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <em>Free Socage.</em> The early history of socage, with its
division into ordinary and privileged, is involved in
obscurities which do not require to be unravelled for the
purpose at present on hand. The services which had to
be returned for both varieties were not military but agricultural,
and their exact nature, and amount varied considerably.
Although not so honourable as chivalry, free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>socage was less burdensome in respect that two of
the most irksome of the feudal incidents, wardship and
marriage, did not apply. When knight’s service was
abolished those who had previously held their lands by
it, whether under the Crown or under a mesne lord, were
henceforward to hold in free socage, which thus came
to be the normal holding throughout England after the
Restoration.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c017'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <em>Fee-farm</em> was the name applied to lands held in
return for services which were neither military nor agricultural,
but consisted only of an annual payment in money.
The “farm” thus indicates the rent paid, which apparently
might vary without limit, although it was long maintained
that a fee-farm rent must amount at least to one quarter
of the annual value. This error seems to have been founded
on a misconstruction of the Statute of Gloucester.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c017'><sup>[67]</sup></a> Some
authorities<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c017'><sup>[68]</sup></a> reject the claims of fee-farm to rank as a tenure
separate from socage; although chapter 37 of Magna Carta
seems to recognize the distinction.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <em>Frankalmoin</em> is the tenure by which pious founders
granted lands to the uses of a religious house. It was also
the tenure on which the great majority of glebe lands
throughout England were held by the village priests, the
parsons of parish churches. The grant was usually
declared to have been made <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in liberam eleemosinam</i></span> or
“free alms” (that is, as a free gift for which no <em>temporal</em>
services were to be rendered).<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c017'><sup>[69]</sup></a> In Scots charters the return
formally stipulated was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>preces et lacrymae</i></span> (the prayers
and tears of the holy men of the foundation for the soul
of the founder).</p>

<p class='c001'>(5) <em>Grand serjeanty</em> was a highly honourable tenure
sharing the distinctions and the burdensome incidents of
knight’s service, but distinct in this, that the tenant, in
place of ordinary military duties, performed some specific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>office in the field, such as carrying the King’s banner or
lance, or else acted as his constable or marshal or other
household officer in the palace, or performed some important
service at the coronation.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c017'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>An often-quoted example of a serjeanty is that of Sir
John Dymoke and his family, who have acted as the
Sovereign’s champions at successive coronations from
Richard II. to Queen Victoria, ready to defend the
Monarch’s title to the throne, if questioned, by battle in
the ancient form.</p>

<p class='c001'>Grand serjeanties were liable to wardship and marriage,
as well as to relief, but not, as a rule, to payment of
scutage.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c017'><sup>[71]</sup></a> William Aguilon, we are told by Madox,<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c017'><sup>[72]</sup></a>
"was charged at the Exchequer with several escuages.
But when it was found by Inquest of twelve Knights of
Surrey that he did not hold his lands in that county
by military tenure, but by serjeanty of finding a Cook
at the King’s coronation to dress victuals in the King’s
kitchen, he was acquitted of the escuages."</p>

<p class='c001'>(6) <em>Petty serjeanty</em> may be described in the words
of Littleton as “where a man holds his lands of our lord
the king to yield to him yearly a bow or sword, or a
dagger or a knife ... or to yield such other small things
belonging to war.”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c017'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The grant of lands on such privileged tenures was
frequently made in early days on account of the special
favour entertained by the King for the original grantee,
due, it might be, to the memory of some great service
rendered at a critical juncture to the King’s person or
interests. A few illustrative examples may be cited
from the spirited description of a scholar whose accuracy
can be relied upon. Serjeanties, as Miss Bateson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>tells us, "were neither always military nor always agricultural,
but might approach very closely the service of
knights or the service of farmers.... The serjeanty of
holding the King’s head when he made a rough passage
across the Channel, of pulling a rope when his vessel
landed, of counting his chessmen on Christmas Day, of
bringing fuel to his castle, of doing his carpentry, of finding
his potherbs, of forging his irons for his ploughs, of tending
his garden, of nursing the hounds gored and injured
in the hunt, of serving as veterinary to his sick falcons,
such and many other might be the ceremonial or menial
services due from a given serjeanty."<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c017'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the days before legal definition had done its work,
it must often have been difficult to say on which side
of the line separating Petty Serjeanties from Grand Serjeanties
any particular holding fell. Gradually, however,
important and practical distinctions were established,
making it necessary that the boundary should be defined
with accuracy. In particular, the rule was established that
Petty Serjeanties, while liable for relief, were exempt
altogether from the burdensome incidents of wardship and
marriage, which Grand Serjeanties shared with lands held
by ordinary Barony or Knight’s service.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c017'><sup>[75]</sup></a> Thus the way
was prepared for the practical identification of the Petty
Serjeanties with ordinary socage at a later date.</p>

<p class='c001'>(7) <em>Burgage</em>, confined exclusively to lands within free
boroughs, is mentioned as a separate tenure by Littleton,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c017'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
and his authority receives support from the words of
chapter 37 of Magna Carta. Our highest modern authorities,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c017'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
however, consider that it never acquired sufficiently
distinct characteristics to warrant its acknowledgment as
such. They treat it rather as a special variety of socage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>used where the tenants were the members of a corporation.
If their opinion must be accepted for England, it
follows that, from common antecedents, entirely different
results have developed in Scotland and in England respectively.
While, north of the Tweed, several of the
well-established English tenures have failed to make good
their right to separate recognition, burgage has established
itself beyond a doubt. Even the levelling process consummated
by the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act of 1874
has not entirely abolished its separate existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The explanation of such differences between English
and Scottish usage easily suggests itself. When feudalism
first took root, the various shades of distinction in
the conditions of holding were exceedingly numerous, and
merged into one another by imperceptible degrees. The
work of definition came later, was essentially artificial in
its nature, and assumed different forms in different lands.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c017'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These tenures, originally six or seven (according as
we exclude or include burgage), have yielded to the
unifying pressure of many centuries. Frankalmoin and
Grand Serjeanty still exist, but rather as ghosts than
realities; the others have all been swallowed up in socage,
which has thus become practically identical with “free-hold.”<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c017'><sup>[79]</sup></a>
This triumph of socage is the result of a long
process. Fee-farm, burgage, and petty serjeanty, always
possessing many features in common, were gradually
assimilated in almost all respects, while a statute (12
Charles II. c. 24) transformed tenure in chivalry also
into socage. The once humble socage has thus risen high,
and now embraces most of the land of England.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c017'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The interest of historians naturally centres round tenure
by knight’s service, which is the very kernel of the
feudal system. Lack of definition in the middle ages was
a fruitful source of quarrel. For a century and more after
the Norman Conquest, the exact amount and nature of
the military services due by a tenant to his lord were
left vague and undetermined. The early Norman Kings
had gradually superseded the old Anglo-Saxon Crown
tenants by new ones of Norman or French extraction, without
formulating any code of regulations for the future. The
whole of England had thus been carved into a number of
estates—the larger known as honours or baronies, and the
smaller as manors. Each Crown tenant (with two exceptions,
of which the Conqueror’s favourite foundation of
Battle Abbey was one) held his lands on condition of
furnishing a certain number of fully armed and mounted
soldiers, always ready to obey the King’s summons in
the event of war. High authorities differ as to when
and by whom the amount of each vassal’s service
was fixed. The common view (promulgated by Prof.
Freeman<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c017'><sup>[81]</sup></a> with his usual vehemence), attributes the allocation
of specific service to Ranulf Flambard, the unscrupulous
tool of William Rufus. Mr. J. H. Round<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c017'><sup>[82]</sup></a> has
recently urged convincing reasons in support of the older
view which attributes it to William I. Two facts, apparently,
are certain: that within half a century from the
Conquest each military tenant was burdened with a definite
amount of knight’s service; and, further, that no formal
record of the amount of such service was made at the
time. There were, as yet, no written charters, and thus
the possibility of disputes remained. Probably such grants
would be made in full <cite>Curia</cite>, and the only record of the
conditions would lie in the memory of the Court itself.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Long before the date of Magna Carta, the various
obligations had been grouped into three classes, which may
be arranged according to their relative importance, as
<em>services</em>, <em>incidents</em>, and <em>aids</em>. Under each of these three
heads, disputes continually arose between the lord who
exacted and the vassal who rendered them.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c017'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The very essence of the feudal relation between the
King as overlord and the Crown tenant as vassal consisted
in the liability of the latter to render “suit and
service,” that is, to follow his lord’s banner in time of war,
and to attend his court in time of peace. It will be more
convenient, however, to reserve full consideration of these
services until the comparatively uncomplicated obligations
known as incidents and aids have been first discussed.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <em>Feudal Incidents.</em> In addition to “suit and service,”
the lord reaped, at the expense of his tenants, a number
of casual profits, which thus formed irregular supplements
to his revenue. These profits, accruing, not annually, but
on the occurrence of exceptional events, came to be known
as “feudal incidents.” They were gradually defined with
more or less accuracy, and their number may be given
as six, viz.:</p>

<p class='c001'>Reliefs, Escheats, Wardships, Marriages, Primer seisins,
and Fines for Alienation.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c017'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>(<i>a</i>) <em>Relief</em> is easily explained. The fee, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>feudum</i></span>, or
hereditary feudal estate, seems to have been the result of
a gradual evolution from the old <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>beneficium</i></span> (or estate held
merely for one lifetime), and that again from the older
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>precarium</i></span> (or estate held only during the will of the
overlord). Grants of land, originally subject to revocation
by the lord, had gradually attained fixity of tenure
throughout the life of the original grantee; and, later
on, they became transmissible to his descendants. The
hereditary principle at last completely triumphed; the
Capitulary of Kiersey (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 877) is said to be the first
authoritative recognition of the heir’s absolute right to
succeed. The process was a gradual one, and it would
seem that even after the Norman Conquest, this rule of
hereditary descent was not established beyond possibility
of dispute.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c017'><sup>[85]</sup></a> This right of the heir to succeed always
remained subject to one condition, namely, the payment
of a sum of money known as “relief.” This was theoretically
an acknowledgment that the new tenant’s right to
ownership was incomplete, until recognized by his superior—a
reminiscence of the earlier <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>precarium</i></span> from which
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>feudum</i></span> had developed.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Relief</em>, then, is the sum payable to a feudal overlord
by an heir for recognition of his title to succeed the
last tenant in possession. The amount remained long undefined,
and the lord frequently asked exorbitant sums.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c017'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) <em>Escheat</em>, it has been said, "signifies the return of
an estate to a lord, either on failure of issue from the
tenant or upon account of such tenant’s felony."<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c017'><sup>[87]</sup></a> This
lucid description conveys a good general conception of
escheat; but it is inaccurate in at least two respects. It
does not exhaust the occasions on which escheat occurs,
and it errs in speaking of “the return” of an estate to
a lord, when, more accurately, that estate had never left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>him, but always remained his property, subject only to a
burden, which was now removed. In theory, the feudal
grant of lands was always conditional; and when the
condition was broken, the grant fell, and the lord found
himself, automatically as it were, once more the absolute
unburdened proprietor, as he had been before the grant
was made. Thereafter, he held the land in demesne, unless
he chose to make a new grant to another tenant.
The word “escheat” was applied indifferently to the lord’s
right to such reversions, and to the actual lands which
had thus reverted. In warlike and unsettled times the
right was a valuable one, for whole families might become
rapidly extinct. When the last tenant left no heir, it
was obvious that the original grant had exhausted itself.
Similarly, when a landholder was convicted of felony, his
blood became, in the phrase of a later day, attainted, and
no one could succeed to any estate through him. If a
man failed in the ordeal of water provided by the Assize
of Clarendon in 1166 for those accused of heinous crimes,
his estates also escheated to his lord. It is true that a
complication arose when it was of treason that the tenant
had been convicted. In that case the king, as the injured
party, had prior rights which excluded those of the
lord. The lands of traitors were forfeited to the Crown.
Even in the case of felony the king had a limited right
to the lands during a period which was strictly defined
by Magna Carta.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c017'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The tenant’s felony and failure of issue were the
two main grounds of escheat, but not the only ones;
the goods of fugitives from justice and of those who
had been formally outlawed also escheated, and Glanvill
adds another case,<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c017'><sup>[89]</sup></a> namely, female wards guilty of unchastity
(an offence which spoiled the king’s market).
Failure to obey a summons to the feudal levy in
time of war might also be made a ground of forfeiture.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c017'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Escheat was thus a peculiarly valuable right both to
the Crown and to mesne lords. Its effect was simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>this: one link in the feudal chain was struck out, and
the links on either side were fitted together. If the
defaulter was a Crown tenant, all his former sub-tenants,
whether freeholders or villeins, moved up one rung
in the feudal ladder and held henceforward directly of
the king, who enjoyed the entire complexus of legal
rights previously enjoyed by the defaulter in addition to
those previously enjoyed by himself: rents, crops, timber,
casual profits, and advowsons of churches falling vacant;
jurisdictions and the profits of jurisdictions; services of
villeins; reliefs, wardships, and marriages of freeholders
as these became exigible.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Crown, however, while taking everything the
defaulter might have taken before default, must take
nothing more—so at least Magna Carta<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c017'><sup>[91]</sup></a> provides. The
rights and status of innocent sub-tenants must not be
prejudiced by the misdeeds of their defaulting mesne
lord.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>c</i>) <em>Wardships</em> are described in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dialogus de Scaccario</cite></span>
as “escheats along with the heir” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>escaeta cum
herede</i></span>).<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c017'><sup>[92]</sup></a> This expression does not occur elsewhere, but
it would be impossible to find any description of wardship
which throws more light on its nature and consequences.
When the heir of a deceased tenant was unfitted
to bear arms by reason of his tender years, the
lands were practically, during his minority, without an
effective owner. The lord accordingly treated them as
temporarily escheated. During the interval of nonage,
the lord entered into possession, drew the revenues, and
applied them to his own purposes, subject only to the
obligation of maintaining and training the heir in a manner
suited to his station in life. Frequently, considerable
sums were thus spent. The <cite>Pipe Roll</cite> of the seventeenth
year of Henry II. shows how out of a total revenue of
£50 6s. 8d. from the Honour of “Belveeir,” £18 5s.
had been expended on the children of the late tenant.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c017'><sup>[93]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Wardship came to an end with the full age of the
ward, that is, in the case of a military tenant, on the
completion of his twenty-first year, “in that of a holder
in socage on the completion of the fifteenth, and in the
case of a burgess when the boy can count money, measure
cloth, and so forth.”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c017'><sup>[94]</sup></a> Wardship of females normally
ended at the age of fourteen, "because that a woman
of such age may have a husband able to do knight’s
service."<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c017'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>All the remunerative consequences flowing from escheat
flowed also from wardship—rents, casual profits,
advowsons, services of villeins, and reliefs. Unlike escheats,
however, the right of the Crown here was only temporary,
and Magna Carta sought<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c017'><sup>[96]</sup></a> to provide that the implied
conditions should be respected by the Crown’s bailiffs or
nominees. The lands must not be wasted or exhausted,
but restored to the young owner when he came of age
in as good condition as they had been at the commencement
of the wardship.</p>

<p class='c001'>One important aspect of this right ought to be
specially emphasized. The Crown’s wardship affected
bishoprics as well as lay baronies, extending over the
temporalities of a See between the death of one prelate
and the instalment of his successor. Thus, it was to the
king’s interest to place obstacles in the way of all
appointments to vacant sees, since the longer the delay,
the longer the Exchequer drew the revenues and casual
profits.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c017'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>This right was carefully reserved to the Crown, even
in the very comprehensive charter in which John granted
freedom of election, dated 21st November, 1214.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c017'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>d</i>) <em>Marriage</em> as a feudal incident belonging to the lord
is difficult to define generally, since its meaning changed.
Originally it seems to have implied little more than the
right of a lord to forbid an heiress, holding a fief under
him, to marry a personal enemy, or some one otherwise
unsuitable. Such veto was only reasonable, since the
husband of the heiress would become the owner of the fee
and the tenant of the lord. This negative right had almost
necessarily a positive side; the claim to concur in the
choice of a husband gradually expanded into an absolute
right of the lord to dispose by sale or otherwise of the
lands and person of his female ward. The prize might
go as a bribe to any unscrupulous gentleman of fortune
who placed his sword at the King’s disposal, or it might
be made the subject of auction to the highest bidder. The
lady passed as a mere adjunct to her own estates, and
ceased, strictly speaking, to have any voice in choosing a
partner for life. She might protect herself indeed against
an obnoxious husband by out-bidding her various suitors.
Large sums were frequently paid for leave to marry a
specified individual or to remain single.</p>

<p class='c001'>This right seems, at some uncertain date, to have been
extended from females to males, and instances of sums
thus paid occur in the <cite>Pipe Rolls</cite>. It is difficult at first
sight to imagine how the Crown found a market for such
wares as male wards; but probably wealthy fathers were
ready to purchase desirable husbands for their daughters.
Thus in 1206 a certain Henry of Redeman paid forty marks
for the hand and lands of the heir of Roger of Hedon,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad opus filiae suae</i></span>,”<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c017'><sup>[99]</sup></a> while Thomas Basset secured a prize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>in the person of the young heir of Walerand, Earl of
Warwick, to the use of any one of his daughters.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c017'><sup>[100]</sup></a> This
extension to male heirs is usually explained to have been
founded on a strained construction of chapter 6 of Magna
Carta, but the beginnings of the practice can be traced
much earlier than 1215.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c017'><sup>[101]</sup></a> The lords’ right to sell their
wards was recognized and defined by the Statute of Merton,
chapter 6. The attempts made to remedy some of the
most serious abuses of the practice may be read in Magna
Carta.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c017'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Hallam<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c017'><sup>[103]</sup></a> considers that “the rights, or feudal
incidents, of wardship and marriage were nearly peculiar
to England and Normandy,” and that the French kings<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c017'><sup>[104]</sup></a>
never “turned this attribute of sovereignty into a means of
revenue.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>e</i>) <em>Primer Seisin</em>, which is usually regarded as a separate
incident, and figures as such in Blackstone’s list, is perhaps
better understood, not as an incident at all, but rather
as a special procedure—effective and summary—whereby
the Crown could enforce the four incidents already described.
It was an exclusive prerogative of the Crown,
denied to mesne lords.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c017'><sup>[105]</sup></a> When a Crown tenant died,
the King’s officers had the right to enter upon immediate
possession, and to exclude the heir, who could not touch
his father’s lands without specific permission from the
Crown. He had first to prove his title by inquest, to
give security for any balance of relief and other debts
unpaid, and to perform homage.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c017'><sup>[106]</sup></a> It will be readily seen
what a strong strategic position all this assured to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>King in any disputes with the heir of a dead vassal.
If the Exchequer had doubtful claims against the deceased,
its officials could satisfy themselves before admitting the
heir to possession. If the heir showed any tendency to
evade payment of feudal incidents, the Crown could checkmate
his moves. If the succession was disputed, the King
might favour the claimant who pleased or paid him most;
or, under colour of the dispute, refuse to disgorge the estate
altogether—holding it in custody analogous to wardship,
and meanwhile drawing the profits. If the son and heir
happened to be from home when his father died, he would
probably experience great difficulty, when he returned, in
forcing the Crown to restore the estates. Such was the
experience of William Fitz-Odo on returning from Scotland
in 1201 to claim his father’s carucate of land in Bamborough.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c017'><sup>[107]</sup></a>
Primer seisin was thus not so much a separate
incident, as a right peculiar to the Crown to take summary
measures for the satisfaction of all incidents or other claims
against a deceased tenant or his heir. Magna Carta
admitted this prerogative whilst guarding against its
abuse.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c017'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>f</i>) <em>Fines for alienation</em> occupy a place by themselves.
Unlike other incidents already discussed, they
became exigible not on the tenant’s death, but on his
wishing to part with his estate to another during his own
lifetime, either as a gift or in return for a price. How
far could he effect this without consent of his lord? This
was, for many centuries, a subject of frequent and heated
disputes, often settled by compromises, in which the tenant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>paid a fine to the lord for permission to sell. Such fines
are payable at the present day in Scotland (under the
name of “compositions”) from feus granted prior to 1874;
and, where no sum has been mentioned in the Feu Charter,
the law of Scotland defines the amount exigible as one
year’s rent. John’s Magna Carta contains no provisions on
this subject. Disputes, long and bitter, took place later
in the thirteenth century; but their history is irrelevant
to the present inquiry.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c017'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>II. <em>Feudal Aids.</em> The feudal tenant, in addition to fulfilling
all the essentials of the feudal relation and also all
the burdensome incidents already enumerated, was expected
to come to the aid of his lord in any special crisis or emergency.
The help thus rendered was by no means reckoned
as a payment to account of the other obligations, which had
also to be paid in full. The additional sums thus given
were technically known as “aids.” At first, the occasions
on which these might be demanded were varied and
undefined. Gradually, however, they were limited to
three. Glanvill,<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c017'><sup>[110]</sup></a> indeed, mentions only two, namely, the
knighting of the overlord’s eldest son, and the marriage
of his eldest daughter; but he intends these, perhaps,
merely as illustrations rather than as forming an exhaustive
list. Before the beginning of the thirteenth century the
recognized aids were clearly three—the ransoming of the
king and the two already mentioned. This understanding
was embodied in Magna Carta.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c017'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A tradition has been handed down from an early date,
that these aids were in reality voluntary offerings made by
the tenant as a mark of affection, and forming no part of
his legal obligations.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c017'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>This plainly became, however, a legal fiction, as regarded
the aids acknowledged by customary law; the tenant dared
not refuse to pay the recognized three. As regarded any
further payments, it was by no means a fiction. When
the Crown desired to exact contributions for any other
reason, it required to obtain the consent of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commune
concilium</i></span>. This, for example, was done by Henry III.
before taking an aid on the marriage of his eldest sister.
The importance of the necessity for such consent can
hardly be exaggerated in its bearing on the origin of the
rights of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Great Charter, while confirming the tacit compromise
arrived at by custom, whereby only the three
aids might be taken without consent of the baronage, left
the <em>amount</em> of such aids undefined, contenting itself with
the extremely vague provision that they should be “reasonable.”
Examples of such payments, both before and after
the Charter, are readily found in the Exchequer Rolls.
Thus, in the fourteenth year of Henry II., that king took
one mark per knight’s fee on marrying his daughter Maud
to the Duke of Saxony. Henry III. took 20s. and
Edward I. 40s. for a similar purpose. For Richard’s
ransom, 20s. had been exacted from each knight’s fee
(save those owned by men actually serving in the field);
and Henry III. took 40s. in his thirty-eighth year at the
knighting of his son. Probably there existed, at an early
date, some understanding as to the limits within which
“reasonableness” should be reckoned, but the amount was
never stated in black and white before the third year of
Edward I. The Statute of Westminster I.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c017'><sup>[113]</sup></a> fixed the
“reasonable” aid payable, not to the Crown but, to mesne
lords at 20s. per knight’s fee, and 20s. for every estate
in socage of £20 annual value. This rate, it will be
observed, is one-fifth of the knight’s relief.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c017'><sup>[114]</sup></a> The Crown,
in thus enforcing “reason” on mesne lords, seems never
to have intended that the same limit should hamper its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>own dealings with Crown tenants, but continued to exact
larger sums whenever it thought fit.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c017'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Thus £2 per fee was taken in 1346 at the knighting
of the Black Prince. A Statute of Edward III.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c017'><sup>[116]</sup></a> at last
extended to the Crown the same measure of “reasonableness”
as had been applied three-quarters of a century
earlier to mesne lords. The last instances of the exaction
of aids in England occur as late as the reign of James I.,
who, in 1609, demanded one for the knighting of the ill-fated
Prince Henry, and in 1613 another for the marriage
of his daughter Elizabeth to the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p class='c001'>III. <em>Suit and Service.</em> This phrase expresses the essential
obligations inherent in the very nature of the feudal
relation. It may be expanded (as regards tenure in chivalry)
into the duty of attendance at the lord’s court, whether it
met for administrative or judicial purposes, or for reasons of
mere display, and the further duty of military service under
that lord’s banner in the field. Suit, or attendance at court,
had ceased to be an urgent question before the reign of John.
Indeed, the barons, far from objecting to be present there,
were gradually approaching the modern conception, which
regards it as a privilege rather than a burden to attend
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commune concilium</i></span>—the embryo Parliament—of the
King. They urged, in especial, that only in a full feudal
court, at which each great Crown tenant had a right to
appear, could any one of their number be judged in a plea
involving loss of lands or of personal status.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c017'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was far otherwise with the duties of military service,
which were rendered every year more unwillingly, partly
because of the increased frequency of warlike expeditions,
partly because of the greater cost of campaigning in distant
lands like Poitou, partly because the English barons were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>completely out of sympathy with John’s foreign policy and
with him. We have seen that the want of definition and
looseness of practice in the reign of William the Conqueror
left to future ages a legacy fertile in disputes. William I.
and his barons lived in the present; and the present did
not urgently call for definition. Therefore, the exact
duration of the military service to be rendered, and the
exact conditions (if any) on which exemption could be
claimed, were left originally quite vague. Such carelessness
is easily explained. Both Crown and barons hoped
that by leaving matters undefined, they would be able to
alter them to their own advantage. This policy was sure
to lead to bitter quarrels in the future, but circumstances
delayed their outbreak. The magnates at first readily
followed William to the field wherever he went, since their
interests were identical with his, while warfare was their
normal occupation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The exact amount of military service was gradually
fixed by custom, and both sides acquiesced in reckoning
the return due (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>servitium debitum</i></span>) for each knight’s fee
or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>scutum</i></span> as the service of one fully armed horseman
during forty days. There were still, however, innumerable
minor points on which disputes might arise, and
these remained even in 1215. Indeed, although several
chapters of the Great Charter attempted to settle certain
of these disputed points, others were left as bones of
contention to subsequent reigns: for example, the exact
equipment of a knight; the liability to serve for more
than forty days on receiving pay for the extra time; what
extent of exemption (if any) might be claimed by churchmen
holding baronies on the ground that they could not
fight in person; how far a tenant might compromise for
actual service by tendering money; whether attendance and
money might not both be refused, if the King did not
lead his forces in person; and whether service was equally
due from all estates for foreign wars as for home ones.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c017'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Such difficulties were increased, as time went on, rather
than removed. The Conqueror’s followers had possessed,
like their lord, estates on both sides of the Channel: his
wars were theirs. Before John’s reign, these simple relations
had become complicated by two considerations. By forfeitures
and the division of inheritances between sons of
one father, holders of English fiefs and holders of Norman
fiefs had become distinct; the English barons had in
1213 nothing at stake in the Crown’s selfish schemes of
aggrandisement or defence. The England of John Lackland,
like the England of William of Orange, objected to
be entangled in foreign wars in the interests of foreign
possessions of the King. On the other hand, the gradual
expansion of the dominions of the wearers of the English
Crown increased the number of their wars with the
number of their interests, and increased, too, the trouble
and expense of each expedition. The small wars with
Wales and Scotland formed a sufficient drain on the
resources of English magnates without their being summoned
in intermediate years to fight in Maine or Gascony.
The greater number of campaigns might well be
reckoned a breach of the spirit of the original agreement.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were the barons bound to follow John in a forlorn
attempt, of which they disapproved, to recover his lost fiefs
from the French Crown? Or were they bound to support
him only in his legitimate schemes as King of England?
Or were they, by way of compromise, liable for services
in the identical possessions held by William the Conqueror
at the date when their ancestors first got their fiefs—that
is, for wars in England and Normandy alone? Tenderness
for legal subtleties or strict logic could hardly be
expected from the malcontents of the northern counties,
smarting under a dumb sense of wrong. Despising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>all nice definition, they declared roundly in 1213 that
they owed no service whatsoever out of England.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c017'><sup>[119]</sup></a> This
extreme claim put them clearly in the wrong, since
John had many precedents to the contrary ready to lay
before them. When the King, on his return from his
unfortunate expedition in 1214, demanded a scutage
from all who had not followed him to Poitou, the malcontents
declared that they had no obligation either to follow
him out of the kingdom, or to pay a scutage in lieu
thereof.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c017'><sup>[120]</sup></a> Pope Innocent was probably correct in condemning
this contention as founded neither on English
law nor on feudal custom.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c017'><sup>[121]</sup></a> There is some ground for
believing that a compromise was mooted on the basis
that the barons should agree to serve in Normandy and
Brittany, as well as in England, on being exempted from
fighting elsewhere abroad.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c017'><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A definite understanding on this vital question was
never arrived at—not even on paper, since chapter 16
of Magna Carta contented itself with the bald provision
that existing services were not to be increased
(without defining what these were). This was merely to
shelve the difficulty: the dispute went on under varying
forms and led to a violent clashing of wills in the unseemly
wrangle between Edward I. and his Constable
and Marshal, dramatized in a classic passage by Walter
of Hemingburgh.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c017'><sup>[123]</sup></a> Strangely enough, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Confirmatio Cartarum</cite></span>
of 1297, which was, in part, the outcome of this
later quarrel, omits (like Magna Carta itself)<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c017'><sup>[124]</sup></a> all reference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>to foreign service. The total omission from both charters
of all mention of the chief cause of dispute is noteworthy.
It must be remembered, however, that the question
of liability to serve abroad had practically resolved itself
into that of liability to scutage, and that chapters 12 and
14 of the Charter of 1215 provided an adequate check
on the levy of all scutages; but this is a subject of crucial
importance, which requires separate and detailed treatment.</p>

<p class='c001'>IV. <em>Scutage.</em> The Crown did not always insist on
actual personal service, but was frequently willing to accept
a commutation in the form of a money payment. This
subject of scutage is one of the most vexed of questions;
all received opinions of yesterday having to-day been thrown
into the melting pot. Serious attempts constructively to
restate the whole subject have hardly been made; and no
conclusions have yet received general acceptance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Three modifications, however, of the theories of Stubbs
and Freeman, once universally accepted, seem likely to be
soon established: (1) that “scutage” is an ambiguous term
with a vague general meaning as well as a narrow technical
meaning; (2) that the importance of the changes
introduced by Henry II. in 1156 and 1159 has been
much exaggerated; and (3) that at a later time, probably
during John’s reign, scutage changed its character. It
ceased to be normally a commutation of service, since it
was not infrequently exacted by the Crown in <em>addition</em>
to military service actually performed. Each of these
propositions requires explanation.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Scutagium,” or “shield-money,” often means, it is true,
a specific sum of so much per knight’s fee (normally twenty
shillings) accepted by the King in lieu of the personal
service in his army due by his tenants <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in capite</i></span>. Thus it
is, as Dr. Stubbs explains, “an honourable commutation for
personal service”;<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c017'><sup>[125]</sup></a> but it is also loosely used<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c017'><sup>[126]</sup></a> to denote
any exaction whatsoever assessed on a feudal basis (that is,
taken exclusively from holders of fiefs) irrespective of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>occasion of its levy. Thus, money taken in name of one
of the three feudal <em>aids</em> is sometimes described as a scutage;
and other instances might be cited.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, learned opinion tends towards the belief that
Henry II. made no radical or startling alteration. Professor
Freeman, Dr. Stubbs, and their adherents familiarized
a bygone generation of historians with the view
that one of Henry’s most important reforms was to
allow his Crown tenants at their discretion to substitute
payments in money for the old obligation of personal
service in the field—this option being granted to ecclesiastics
in 1156, and to lay barons in 1159. Such a
theory had <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> much to recommend it. A measure
of this nature, while giving volume and elasticity to the
resources of the Crown, was calculated subtly to undermine
the basis of the feudal tie; but Henry, farseeing statesman
as he was, could not discard the ideals of his own generation.
No evidence that he made any sweeping change is
forthcoming. His grandfather, Henry I., is shown by the
evidence of extant charters to have accepted money in place
of the services of knights <em>when it suited him</em> (notably from
church fiefs in 1109),<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c017'><sup>[127]</sup></a> and there is no evidence (direct or
indirect) to show that the grandson accepted such commutation
<em>when it did not suit him</em>. The conclusions formulated,
with his usual energy, by Mr. J. Horace Round, lie implicitly
in the examples from the <cite>Pipe Rolls</cite> stored in the great
work of Madox. From these it would appear that the
procedure of the Exchequer of the great Angevin and his
two sons might be explained in some such propositions
as these:</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>a</i>) The option to convert service into scutage lay with
the Crown, and not with the tenants, either individually
or as a body. When the King summoned his feudal army
no baron could (as Professor Freeman would have us
believe) simply stay away under obligation of paying a
small fixed sum to the Exchequer. On the contrary,
Henry and his sons jealously preserved the right to insist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>on <em>personal</em> service whenever it suited them; even efficient
substitutes were not always accepted, much less money
payments.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) If the individual wished to stay at home he required
to make a special bargain to pay such fine as the King
agreed to accept—and sometimes he had to send a substitute
in addition. The <cite>Pipe Rolls</cite> show many such payments by
stay-at-homes <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ne transfretent</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro remanendo ab exercitu</i></span>.
Thus, in the twelfth year of John’s reign a Crown tenant
paid a fine “that he might send two knights to serve for
him in the army of Ireland.”<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c017'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes, indeed, Henry II. might announce that
payments at a certain rate would be accepted generally
in lieu of service, but this was when it suited him, not
when it suited his military tenants. In this connection
twenty shillings per fee became recognized as a usual,
though by no means a necessary, rate.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>c</i>) In the ordinary case, if the tenant in chivalry neither
went in person nor obtained leave from the Crown to stay
away, he was in evil plight. Defaulters were “<em>in mercy</em>”;
they sometimes forfeited their entire estates to the Crown,<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c017'><sup>[129]</sup></a>
and might be glad to accept such terms of pardon as a
gracious King condescended to hold out to them. Sometimes,
it is true, quite small amercements were inflicted;
the Abbot of Pershore in 1196 escaped with an amercement
of 40s.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c017'><sup>[130]</sup></a> Such leniency, however, was exceptional,
and the result of special royal clemency.</p>

<p class='c001'>The right to determine the amount of amercements to be
taken lay within the province of the Barons of the
Exchequer, who also judged whether or not lands had
escheated by default.</p>

<p class='c001'>Henry II. seems to have levied money in name of
scutage only when actually at war—on seven occasions
in all during a reign of thirty-five years; and only once
at a rate exceeding 20s., if we may trust Mr. Round,<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c017'><sup>[131]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>that when he was putting forth a special effort against
Toulouse. Richard I., with all his rapaciousness, levied,
apparently, only four scutages during ten years, and the
rate of 20s. was never exceeded even in the King’s hour
of urgent need,—in 1194, when the arrears of his
ransom had to be paid and preparations simultaneously
made for war in Normandy.</p>

<p class='c001'>At John’s accession, then, three rules might be regarded
as having all the prescriptive force of a long unbroken
tradition, namely, (1) that scutage was a reserve for extraordinary
emergencies, not a normal yearly burden; (2) that
the recognized maximum was 20s. per knight’s fee, while
a lower rate (13s.4d. and even 10s.) had occasionally
been accepted; and (3) that the payment of scutage to
the King at a rate previously fixed by him acted as a complete
discharge of all obligations due for that occasion.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it can be proved that John, almost from his accession,
deliberately altered all three of these well-established rules,
and that too in the teeth of the keen opposition of a high-spirited
baronage whose members felt that their pride and
prestige as well as their money-bags were attacked, a distinct
step is taken towards understanding the crisis of 1215.
Such knowledge would explain why a storm, long brewing,
burst in John’s reign, neither sooner nor later; and even
why some of the disreputable stories told by the chroniclers
and accepted by Blackstone and others, found inventors and
willing believers.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is here maintained that John did make changes in all
three directions; and, further, that the incidence of this
increase in feudal burdens was rendered even more unendurable
by two considerations:—because at his accession
there remained unpaid (particularly from the fiefs of the
northern knights) large arrears of the scutages imposed in
his brother’s reign,<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c017'><sup>[132]</sup></a> and because in June, 1212, John drew
the feudal chain tight by a drastic and galling measure.
In that month he instituted a strict inquest into the
amount of feudal service exigible from every estate in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>England, to prevent any dues escaping his wide net, and
to revive all services and payments that had lapsed or
were in danger of lapsing.</p>

<p class='c001'>That he made the first two changes becomes a certainty
from a glance at the table of scutages actually extorted
during his reign, as these are here copied from a list
compiled by a writer of authority who has no special
theory to support,<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c017'><sup>[133]</sup></a> viz.:</p>

<p class='c001'>It will be seen that, in the very first year of his reign,
John took a scutage, and that, too, at a rate above the
established normal, at two marks per <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>scutum</i></span> (only once
equalled, thirty years before, and then under special
circumstances). Even one such exaction must have made
the already sulky Crown tenants look askance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next year John wisely allowed them breathing space;
then without a break in each of the third, fourth, fifth,
sixth and seventh years of his reign, scutages were extorted
in quick succession at the high rate of two marks. If
John meant to establish this as a new normal rate, he
did so not without some show of reason, since that would
exactly pay the wages of a knight at 8d. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per diem</i></span> (the
rate then current), for a period of forty days (the exact
term recognized by public opinion as the maximum of
compulsory feudal service).</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Fines</em>, in addition to this scutage of two marks, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>apparently exacted from those who had not made the
necessary compromise for personal service in due time.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c017'><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These scutages were collected with increasing difficulty,
and arrears gradually accumulated; but the spirit of opposition
increased even more rapidly. In 1206, apparently,
the breaking point was almost reached.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c017'><sup>[135]</sup></a> Accordingly, in
that year, some slight relaxation was allowed—the annual
scutage was reduced from two marks to 20s. John’s
needs, however, were as great as ever, and would prevent
all further concessions in future years, unless something
untoward happened. Something untoward <em>did</em> happen in
the summer of 1207, when John quarrelled with the Pope.
This event came in time, not as John thought to <em>prevent</em>,
but, as the sequel proved, merely to <em>postpone</em>, the crisis of
the quarrel with the baronage. John had, for the time
being, the whole of the confiscated property of the clergy
in his clutches. The day of reckoning for this luxury
was still far distant, and the King could meanwhile enjoy
a full exchequer without goading his Crown tenants to
rebellion. For three years no scutage was imposed. In
1209, however, financial needs again closed in on John,
and a new scutage of two marks was levied; followed in
the next year actually by two scutages, the first of two
marks against Wales, and the second of 20s. against
Scotland. John never knew when to stop. These three
levies, amounting to a total of five-and-a-half marks per fee
within two years, strained the tension almost to breaking
point.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the two financial years immediately following
(Michaelmas, 1211, to Michaelmas, 1213) no scutage was
imposed. John, however, although he thus a second time
relaxed the tension, had no intention to do so for long. On
the contrary, he determined to ascertain if scutages could
not be made to yield more in the future. By writs, dated
1st June, 1212, he instituted a great Inquest throughout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>the land. Commissioners were appointed to take sworn
verdicts of local juries as to the amount of liability due
by each Crown vassal. Mr. Round<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c017'><sup>[136]</sup></a> considers that previous
writers have unaccountably ignored the importance of this
measure, “an Inquest worthy to be named in future by
historians in conjunction with those of 1086 and 1166,”<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c017'><sup>[137]</sup></a>
and describes it as an effort “to revive rights of the Crown
alleged to have lapsed.” It is possible that John, by this
Inquest of 1212, sought also (unsuccessfully, as the sequel
proved) to do what Henry had done successfully in
1166—that is, to increase the amount of knights’ fees
on which each Crown tenant’s scutage was assessed by
adding to the previous total the number of knights recently
enfeoffed.</p>

<p class='c001'>John clearly intended by this Inquest, the returns to
which were due on the 25th June, 1212, to prepare the
necessary machinery for wringing the uttermost penny out
of the next scutage when occasion for one again arose.
That occasion came in 1214.</p>

<p class='c001'>Up to this date, even John had not dared to exact
a rate of more than two marks per knight’s fee; but
the weight of his constant scutages had been increased
by the fact that he sometimes exacted personal services
in addition, and that he inflicted crushing fines upon
those who neither went nor arranged beforehand terms
of composition with the King.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c017'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Thus gradually and insidiously throughout the entire
reign of John, the stream of feudal obligations by many
different channels steadily rose until the barons feared
that nothing of their property would be saved from the
torrent. The normal rate of scutage had been raised, the
frequency of its imposition had been increased, the conditions
of foreign service had become more burdensome,
and the objects of foreign expeditions more unpopular;
while attempts were sometimes made to exact both service
and scutage in the same year. The limit of the barons’
endurance was reached when, on 26th May, 1214, John,
already discredited by his unsuccessful expeditions in
Poitou, soon to be followed by the utter overthrow of his
allies at Bouvines, issued writs for a scutage at the
unheard-of rate of three marks, grounded doubtless on
the inquest of 1212 and unusually far-reaching in the
subjects which it embraced.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c017'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Then the final crash came; this writ was like a call
to arms—a call not to follow the King’s banner, but to
fight against him.</p>

socage but “feu” (resembling the English fee-farm). Holdings in feu
are still familiar to Scots lawyers. They are originated by a formal
charter, followed by registration (the modern equivalent of infeftment
or feudal investiture), thus preserving an unbroken connection with the
feudal conveyancing of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r83'>83</a>. All three forms of feudal obligation—service, incidents, and aids—have
long been obsolete in England. The statute 12 Charles II. c. 24
swept away the feudal <em>incidents</em> along with the feudal system; centuries
before, <em>scutages</em> in lieu of military <em>service</em> had become obsolete in the
transition from the system of feudal finance to that of national finance,
effected by the Crown in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Feudal
<em>aids</em> were also long obsolete, although James I., in desperate straits for
money, had attempted to revive two of them. In France the feudal
system, with all its burdensome obligations, remained in full vigour until
it was abolished in one night by the famous decree of the National
Assembly of 4th August, 1790. In Scotland, the feudal system of land
tenure still exists, and certain of its incidents (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>e.g.</i></span> reliefs and compositions

<h3 id='ROYALJUSTICE' class='c015'>III. Royal Justice and Feudal Justice.</h3>

<p class='c016'>A well-known aphorism of legal text-books, couched in
language unusually figurative, declares the King to be
“the sole fountain of justice.” Correct as it is to apply
this metaphor to the present state of the constitution, it
would be an anachronism and a blunder to transport it
into the thirteenth century. In John’s reign there still
were—as there had been for centuries—not one, but
many competing jurisdictions. It was by no means a
foregone conclusion that the King’s Courts were the
proper tribunals to which a wronged individual must
repair to seek redress. On the contrary, the great bulk
of the rural population, the villeins, had no <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>locus standi</i></span>
except in the court of the manor to which they belonged;
while the doors of the royal Courts had been closed
against the ordinary freeman previous to the reign of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Henry II. Royal justice was still the exception, not the
rule. Each man must seek redress, in the ordinary case,
in his own locality. To dispense justice to the nation at
large was no part of the normal business of a medieval
King.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <em>Rival Systems of Law Courts.</em> In the thirteenth
century, there existed not one source of justice, but many.
Rival courts, eagerly competing to extend their own sphere
of usefulness and to increase their own fees, existed in
a bewildering multitude. Putting aside for the moment
the Courts Christian, the Borough Courts, the Forest
Courts, and all exceptional or peculiar tribunals, there
existed three great rival systems of jurisdiction which
may be named in the order in which they became in
turn prominent in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>  (1) <em>Local or District Courts.</em> Justice was originally a
local product, and administered in rude tribunals, which
partook more or less of a popular character. Each shire
had its council or assembly for hearing pleas, known as
a “shire-moot” in Anglo-Saxon days, and usually as a
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>comitatus</i></span>” after the Norman Conquest; while each of
the smaller districts subdividing the shire, and forming
units of administration for purposes of taxation, defence,
justice, and police, had a moot or council of its own,
serving as a court of law, to which the inhabitants
of the various villages brought their pleas in the first
instance. These smaller districts were known as hundreds
in the south, and as wapentakes (a name of Danish derivation)
in the north.</p>

<p class='c001'>The theory generally received is that all freemen were
originally suitors in the courts of the shire and the hundred,
and that the whole body of those present, the ordinary
peasant (“ceorl”) equally with the man of noble blood
(“eorl”), took an active part in the proceedings, pronouncing
(or, at least, concurring in) the judgments or dooms there
declared; but that, as time progressed, the majority of the
Anglo-Saxon ceorls sank to the half-servile position of
villeins—men tied for life to the soil of the manor, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>passing, like property, from father to son. These villeins,
although still subjected to the burden of attendance, and to
some of the other duties of their former free estate, were
deprived of all those rights which had once formed the
counterpart of the obligations. Another school of historians,
it is true, denies that the mass of the population, even in
very early times, ever enjoyed the right to any active share
in the dispensation of justice. It is unnecessary here to
attempt a solution of these and many other intricate problems
surrounding the composition and functions of the
courts of shire and hundred; or to discuss the still more
vexed question how far the small assembly of the villagers
of each township is worthy to be reckoned a formal court of
law. It is sufficient to emphasize the importance of the
existence from early times of a complete network of courts,
each dispensing justice for the people of its own district.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <em>Feudal Courts.</em> Centuries before the Norman Conquest,
this system of popular or district justice found
itself confronted with a rival scheme of jurisdictions—the
innumerable private courts belonging to the feudal lords
of the various estates into which the whole of England
had been divided. This new system of private tribunals
(known indifferently as feudal courts, manorial courts,
seignorial courts, or heritable jurisdictions) slowly but
surely, such is the orthodox view generally, although not
universally accepted, gained on the older system of popular
courts of shire, hundred, and wapentake.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c017'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Practically every holder of land in England came to be
also the holder of a court for the inhabitants of that land.
The double meaning of the word “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominus</i></span>” illustrates the
double position of the man who was thus both owner and
lord.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c017'><sup>[141]</sup></a> In the struggle between two schemes of justice, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>tribunals of the feudal magnates easily triumphed, but never
absolutely abolished their rivals. The earlier popular courts
still lived on; but the system of district justice which had
once embraced the whole of England was completely honeycombed
by the growth of the feudal courts. As each once-free
village passed under the domination of a lord, and gradually
became a manor or embryo-manor, the village-moot
(with such rudimentary authority as it may originally have
possessed) gave way before a new manorial court endowed
with much wider powers and with more effective sanction
for enforcing them. Further, as complete hundreds fell
under the control of specially powerful magnates, the entire
courts of these hundreds were replaced by or transformed
into feudal courts; franchises thus took the place of many
of the old popular moots. Still, the older system retained
possession of part of the disputed ground, thanks to the
protection given it in its hour of need by the Crown. A
great majority of the hundreds never bowed to the exclusive
domination of any one lord, and the courts of the shires
were jealously guarded by the Norman Kings against the
encroachment of even the most powerful of barons. It is
true that they only escaped subjection to a local landowner
in order to fall under the more powerful domination of
the Crown. Yet the mere fact that they continued in
existence acted at least as a check on the growth of the
rival system of seignorial tribunals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although it was the policy of the Norman Kings to
prevent their barons from gaining excessive powers of jurisdiction,
it was by no means their policy to oppose these
jurisdictions altogether. On the contrary, the Conqueror
and his sons were glad that order should be enforced and
justice administered, even in a rough-and-ready manner,
in those districts of England whither the Crown’s arm was
not long enough to reach, and where the popular courts
were likely to prove inefficient. Thus, the old system and
the new existed side by side; it was to the interest of the
central government to play off the one against the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>In later days (but not till long after Magna Carta) each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>manorial tribunal split into three distinct courts, according
to the class of pleas it was called upon to try. Later
writers distinguish absolutely from each other, the Court
Baron, settling civil disputes between the freeholders of the
manor; the Court Customary, deciding non-criminal cases
among the villeins; and the Court Leet, a petty criminal
court enforcing order and punishing small offences. The
powers of these courts might vary, and in many districts
the jurisdiction over misdemeanours belonged not to the
steward of the lord of the manor, but to the sheriff in his
half-yearly Circuits or “Tourns” through the county. In
the imperfectly feudalized districts the Tourn of the sheriff,
as the representative of the Crown, performed the same
functions as the Court Leet performed within the territories
of a franchise.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <em>Royal Courts.</em> Originally, the King’s Court had been
merely one feudal court among other feudal courts—differing
in degree rather than in kind from those of the great earls
or barons. The King, as a feudal lord, dispensed justice
among his feudal tenants (whether barons and freemen
or only servile dependents), just as any baron or freeman
dispensed justice among <em>his</em> tenants, bond or free. No one
dreamed, in the time of the Norman Kings, that the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia
Regis</i></span> would or could undertake the enormous labour of
dispensing justice for the whole nation (or even of
supervising the courts which did dispense it). Each
individual must, on the contrary, look for the redress
of wrongs either to the court of the people of his
own district, or to the court of his lord. Royal
justice for all (in the modern sense) was simply impossible.
The monarchy had no machinery at command
for effecting this. The task was a gigantic one, which
no Anglo-Saxon King, which not even William I., could
possibly have undertaken. No attempt in this direction
was made by the Crown until the reign of Henry II., who
was placed in a position of unprecedented power, partly
by circumstances, but chiefly by his great abilities. Even
he, born reformer as he was, would never have increased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>so greatly the labours of government, if he had not clearly
seen how enormously the change would enhance both
the security of his throne and the revenue of his
exchequer.</p>

<p class='c001'>In normal circumstances, then, prior to the Angevin
period, the King’s Court was merely a tribunal for transacting
the king’s own business, or for holding pleas
between the Crown’s own immediate tenants. Even
from an early date, however, the business of the
monarch, from the mere fact that he was lord paramount,
was necessarily wider than the business of
any mesne lord. In a dim way, too, it must have
been apparent from the first, that offences against the
established order were offences also against the king,
and that, therefore, to redress these was the king’s business
competent in the King’s Courts. Further, the
Sovereign’s prerogative quickly waxed strong, and enabled
him to give effect to his wishes in this as in other matters.
The Crown asserted a right (while admitting no corresponding
duty) to investigate any pleas of special
importance, whether civil or criminal. Still, up to the
Norman Conquest, and thereafter under William and his
sons, royal justice had made no deliberate attempt to
become national justice, or to supersede feudal justice.
Each kept to its recognized province. The struggle
between the two began only with the reforms of
Henry II.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c017'><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the three great systems of jurisdiction, popular
justice, feudal justice, and royal justice (each depending
on a different principle) succeeded each other, on the
whole, in the order in which they are here named. Yet
the sequence is in some ways logical rather than chronological.
No absolute line can be drawn, showing where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the supremacy of one principle ended and that of the next
began. For centuries, all three co-existed, and struggled for
the mastery. The germs of manorial jurisdiction may have
been present from an early date. Shire-courts and hundred
courts alike were continually in danger of falling under the
domination of powerful local magnates. Yet the shire-courts
were successful in maintaining till the last (thanks
to royal favour) their independence of the manorial jurisdictions
and their lords; while only a proportion of the
hundred courts fell into bondage.</p>

<p class='c001'>The royal courts, again, exercised an important jurisdiction
from the very foundation of the monarchy; and the
king in person, or by deputy, from an early date, withdrew
special causes from the County Courts, and also interfered
with manorial franchises. Finally, the Courts Baron were
never abolished, but only silently undermined by the policy
of Henry II. and his successors, until they gradually sank
into decrepitude without really ceasing to exist.</p>

<p class='c001'>With these caveats, however, the three systems may be
regarded, in some measure, as following one another in
the order named:—popular justice, feudal justice, royal
justice.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <em>Legal Procedure.</em> The procedure adopted in litigation
in Anglo-Saxon and Norman times was similar in
essentials in all three classes of tribunals, and differed
materially from the practice of courts of law at the
present day. Some knowledge of the more glaring contrasts
between ancient and modern procedure may here be
profitably discussed, not only on account of the interest
inherent in the subject, but also because it will conduce
to an understanding of several otherwise obscure provisions
of Magna Carta.</p>

<p class='c001'>Avoiding technical language, and eliminating special
procedure peculiar to any one court or country, the principal
stages in a normal litigation in a modern court of
law may be given briefly as follows:</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) On the complaint of the party aggrieved—the
plaintiff—a summons, or writ, is issued by an officer of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>the court. Proceedings are opened by the command
addressed to the defendant to appear in court and answer
what is alleged against him.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) Each party lodges written statements of his facts
and pleas—that is, of the circumstances of the case
as they appear to him (or such of them as he hopes to
bring evidence to prove)—on which he founds his claim or
his defence, and of the legal principles he intends to deduce
from these circumstances. When these statements of facts
and pleas have been revised and adjusted, the complete
data are now before the court; each party has finally
stated what he considers essential to his case.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) Proof is, in due course, led; that is, each party is
afforded an opportunity of proving such facts as he has
alleged (and as require proof through the denial of his
opponent). This he may do by documents, witnesses, or
otherwise. Each party has the further privilege of shaking
his opponent’s evidence by cross-examination.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) The next important stage is the debate, the main
object of which is to establish by legal arguments the pleas
founded on; to deduce the legal consequences inherent in
the facts which have been proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>(5) Finally, the judge gives his decision. He has to
determine, after weighing the evidence led by either party,
what facts have really been established, and how far the
various pleas of plaintiff and defendant respectively are
implied in these facts. A considerable amount of thought
and reasoning of such a kind as can be successfully performed
only by a highly trained legal mind is thus necessary
before the final decree or sentence can be pronounced by a
judge in a modern court of law.</p>

<p class='c001'>A trial in Anglo-Saxon and early Norman times
stands in notable contrast to all this in almost every
essential of its stages and procedure, and even more
radically in the spirit which pervades the whole. Thus,
the proceedings, from first to last, were purely oral, there
being no original writ or summons, no written pleadings,
and no record kept of the decision except in the memories
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>of those present. The functions of “the judges” were
entirely different, and demanded no previous professional or
legal training, since they were not required either to weigh
a mass of evidence or to determine the bearing of subtle
legal arguments, but merely to see fairplay, and to decide,
according to simple rules, well established by centuries
of custom, by what test the allegations of plaintiff and
defendant were respectively to stand or fall. Finally,
the arrangement of the stages of the litigation was
entirely different. It is with something of a shock
that the modern lawyer learns that in civil and
criminal causes alike “judgment” invariably preceded
“trial.” Reflection will soon convince him that each of
these words had in the Middle Ages a meaning different
from what it bears to-day. These ancient meanings can
be best understood by following the stages of the old
procedure.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) The initial difficulty was to obtain the presence of
the defendant in court, since there existed a strange
reluctance either to compel his attendance or to allow
judgment to pass against him by default. No initial writ
was issued commanding him to appear; almost endless
delays were allowed.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) When both parties had been, after many adjournments,
actually brought face to face before the court, the
statements alike of the claim and of the defence were
made verbally and in set <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>formulae</i></span>, the slightest slip or
stumble in the words of which involved complete failure.
This is merely one illustration of the tremendously formal
and technical nature of early legal procedure common to
all half-developed systems of jurisprudence.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) Before the plaintiff could put the defendant finally
on his defence, he required to show some preliminary presumption
of the probability or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bona fides</i></span> of his case.
This he usually did by producing two friends ready to
substantiate his claim, known sometimes as his “suit”
(Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>secta</i></span>), or his “fore-witnesses.” Their evidence was
not weighed against the “proof” afterwards led by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>defendant; its object was merely to warrant the Court in
demanding “proof” from the latter at all.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c017'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(4) Then came the judgment—the chief or “medial”
judgment, so called to distinguish it from the less important
final judgment or decree which came at a later
stage. This medial judgment or “doom,” to use the Anglo-Saxon
word, partook in no respect of the nature of the
judgment of a modern tribunal. It came <em>before</em> the proof or
trial, not after it. It consisted indeed in decreeing whether
or no, on the strength of the previous procedure, the
defendant should be put to his proof at all; and if so, <em>what</em>
“proof” should be demanded.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, the exact test to be appointed by the court varied
somewhat, according to circumstances, but long-established
custom had laid down with some exactitude a rule applicable
to every case likely to occur; and, further, the possible
modes of proof were limited to some four or five at the
outside. In Anglo-Saxon times, these were mainly compurgation,
ordeal, witnesses (whose functions were, however,
widely different from those of witnesses in modern law),
and charters. The Norman Conquest introduced for the
new-comers, a form of proof previously unknown in England—"trial
by combat"—which tended, for the upper
classes at least, to supersede all earlier methods of procedure.
The “proof,” of whatever kind it might be, thus
appointed by the “judges” for the defendant’s performance
was technically known as a “law” (Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex</i></span>) in the sense
of a “test” or “trial” or “task,” according to his success
or failure in which his case should stand or fall.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c017'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>It will be apparent that to pronounce a “judgment” in
this sense was a simple affair, a mere formality in the
ordinary case, where room for dubiety could hardly be
admitted; and thus it was possible for “judgment” to be
delivered by all the members of a feudal court, or even by
all the suitors present at a meeting of the hundred or shire-moot.</p>

<p class='c001'>(5) The crucial stage, this “trial” which thus came after
“judgment,” consisted in one party (usually the defendant)
essaying, on the day appointed, to satisfy the court as to
the truth of his allegations by performing the task or “law”
which had been set or “doomed” to him. When this
consisted in the production of a charter, or of “transaction
witnesses” (that is, the testimony of those officials appointed
in each market-town to certify the conclusion of such bargains
as the sale of cattle), it commends itself readily to the
modern understanding and approval. More frequently,
however, it took the form of “an oath with oath-helpers,”
the plaintiff bringing with him eleven or twelve of his
trusty friends or dependents to swear after him the words
of a long and cumbrous oath, under the risk of being
punished as perjurers for any slip in the formula. This
was known also as compurgation. Sometimes the decision
was referred to the intervention of Providence by appealing
to the ordeal of the red-hot iron or the more-dreaded
ordeal of water. After the Norman Conquest, the trial
in all litigations between men of high rank, took the
form of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span> or legally regulated combat between the
parties. The defendant gained his case if he caused the
plaintiff to own himself worsted by uttering the word
“craven.” He gained his case equally if he only held
out till nightfall (when the combat terminated) against
the plaintiff’s attempts to force him to utter that fateful
word.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c017'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The battle was fought out before the “judges,” who, in
the case of an earl or baron, were the other earls and barons
assembled as his peers in the King’s court; and, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>case of the tenant of a mesne lord, were the other freeholders
of the same manor.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ancient “trial” (the importance of which is increased
by the fact that it continued long after 1215, and may be
traced in several clauses of Magna Carta)<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c017'><sup>[146]</sup></a> was thus
something entirely different from the modern “trial.” It
may be said without exaggeration that there was no “trial”
at all in the current meaning of the word—no balancing of
the testimony of one set of witnesses against another, no
open proof and cross-examination, no debate on the legal
principles involved. The ancient “trial” was merely a
formal test, which was, except in the case of battle, entirely
one-sided. The phrase “burden of proof” was inapplicable.
The litigant to whom “a law” was appointed had the
“privilege of proof” rather than the “burden of proof,” and
he usually won his case—especially in compurgation, and
even in ordeal if he had arranged matters properly with
the priest who presided.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c017'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(6) The whole was concluded by the final “judgment,”
or decree, which practically took the form of a sentence
passed on the vanquished. The judges could scarcely be
said to decide the case, since this had already been practically
decided by the success or failure of the party on
whom the proof had been laid. Those who gave sentence
were “judges” merely in the sense of umpires who saw
fairplay to both players, according to the acknowledged
rules of the desperate game.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c017'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In one sense, the final (as opposed to the medial)
“judgment” was determined by the parties themselves, or
by one of them; in another and higher sense the facts
at issue were left to Providence; a miracle, if necessary,
would attest the just claim of the innocent man. Those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>who delivered the final doom, had a purely formal task to
perform, and had little in common with the “judges” of
a modern court.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c017'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The essentials of this procedure were the same in the
Norman as in the Anglo-Saxon period, and that in all
three classes of tribunals—popular courts, manorial courts,
and royal courts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two innovations the Norman Kings did make; they
introduced trial by combat (already sufficiently discussed),
and likewise the continental method of obtaining information
on sworn testimony. Among the prerogatives of the
Norman Dukes one of the most valuable was the right to
compel the sworn evidence of reliable men of any district—men
specially picked for the purpose, and put on oath
before answering the questions asked of them, thus endangering
their eternal welfare in the event of falsehood,
and laying themselves open to temporal penalties for
perjury.</p>

<p class='c001'>This procedure was known as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inquisitio</i></span> (or the seeking
of information) when regarded from the point of view of
the government making the inquiry, and as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>recognitio</i></span> (or
the giving of information) from the point of view of those
supplying it. This extremely simple and practical device
was flexible and capable of extension to endless new uses in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the deft hands of the Norman Kings in England. William
the Conqueror employed it in collecting the laws and
customs of the conquered people, and, later on, in compiling
Domesday Book; while his successors made it the instrument
of various experiments in the science of taxation.
It has a double claim to the interest of the constitutional
historian, because it was one of the influences which helped
to mould our Parliamentary institutions; and because
several of the new uses to which it came to be put had
a close connection with the origin of trial by jury. The
recognitors, indeed, were simply local jurors in a rude or
elementary form.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c017'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>III. <em>Reforms of Henry II. in Law Courts and Legal
Procedure.</em> It was reserved for Henry of Anjou to inaugurate
an entirely new era in the relations of the three classes
of courts. He was the first king deliberately to plan the
overthrow of the feudal jurisdictions by insidiously undermining
them, if not yet by open attack. He was the first
king to reduce the old district courts so thoroughly under
the control of royal officials as to turn them practically into
royal courts. He was the first king also to throw open
the doors of his own courts of law to all-comers, to all
freemen, that is to say, for the despised villein had for
centuries still to seek redress in the court of that very
lord of the manor who was too often his oppressor.</p>

<p class='c001'>In brief, then, Henry’s policy was twofold: to convert
the County Courts practically into Royal Courts, since
in them royal officials now dispensed royal justice
according to the same rules as prevailed at the
King’s own <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia</i></span>; and to reduce all manorial or private
courts to insignificance by diverting pleas to his own
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia</i></span>, and leaving the rival tribunals to die gradually from
inanition. Both branches of this policy met ultimately
with complete success, although the event hung in the
balance until long after his death. The barons, though
partially deceived by the gradual and insidious nature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Henry’s reforms, did what they could to thwart him; but
the current of events was against them and with the Crown.
Royal justice steadily encroached upon feudal justice. One
of the last stands made by the barons has left its traces
plainly written in several chapters of Magna Carta.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c017'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These contain what seem, at first sight, to be merely
trivial alterations of technical points of court procedure;
but inextricably bound up with them are principles of
wide political and constitutional importance. Henry’s policy
was to disguise radical reforms until they looked like
small changes of procedure; it follows that the framers of
Magna Carta, while appearing merely to seek the reversal
of these trivial points, were really seeking to return to
the totally different conditions which had prevailed prior
to the reforms of Henry.</p>

<p class='c001'>A short account of the main outlines of that monarch’s
new system of procedure forms a necessary preliminary
to a complete comprehension of these important chapters
of Magna Carta. Such an account falls naturally into
two divisions.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <em>Criminal Justice.</em> (<i>a</i>) By his Assizes of Clarendon
and Northampton Henry strictly reserved all important
crimes for the exclusive consideration of his own judges
either on circuit or at his court; and he demanded entry
for these judges into franchises, however powerful, for that
purpose. In this part of his policy, the King was completely
successful; heinous crimes were, in the beginning
of the thirteenth century, admitted on all hands to be
“pleas of the Crown” (that is, cases exclusively reserved for
the royal jurisdiction); and Magna Carta made no attempt
to reverse this part of the Crown’s policy. The change
was accepted as inevitable. All that was attempted in
1215 was to obtain a promise that these functions, now
surrendered to the Crown forever, should be discharged
by the Crown’s officials in a proper manner.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c017'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) Henry’s usual good sense, in this matter stimulated
by some notable miscarriages of justice, led him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>question the equity of the procedure usually adopted in
criminal pleas, namely, by “appeal” or formal accusation
by the injured party, or his nearest surviving relative.
He substituted, whenever possible, communal accusation
for individual accusation; that is, the duty of proclaiming
(or indicting) the suspected criminals of each district
before the King’s Justices was no longer left to private
initiative, but was laid on a body of neighbours specially
selected for that purpose—the predecessors of the Grand
Jury of later days. This new procedure, it is true, supplemented
rather than superseded the older procedure; yet
it marked a distinct advance. Appeals were discouraged
and exact rules laid down restricting the right of accusation
to certain cases and individuals.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c017'><sup>[153]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>c</i>) A necessary complement of the discouragement of
appeals was the discouragement of “trial by combat”
also, since that formed the natural sequel. An ingenious
device was invented and gradually extended to an increasing
number of cases; an accused individual might
apply for a writ known as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de odio et atia</i></span>, and thus
avoid the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span> altogether by having his guilt or
innocence determined by what was practically a jury of
neighbours.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c017'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <em>Civil Justice.</em> Henry’s innovations under this head
were equally important.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>a</i>) An unflinching rule was established that no case
could be brought before the royal court until a writ
had been obtained from chancery. This had to be paid for,
sometimes at a fixed rate, and sometimes at whatever sum
the Crown demanded. The whole procedure in the royal
courts, which followed the issuing of such a writ, came
to be known as “the writ process.” Once it was issued,
all proceedings in other courts must stop. One special
form of writ (known as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe</i></span>), in particular, became
a royal instrument for removing before the King’s own
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia</i></span> cases pending in the manorial courts of mesne
lords. To do this was to enrich the King at the expense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of some baron or other freeman, by bringing to
the Exchequer fees which otherwise would be paid to the
owner of the private court. This was plainly "to cause
a freeman to lose his court"—an abuse specially struck
at by chapter 34 of the Great Charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) The mass of new business attracted to the King’s
Courts made it necessary to increase, the staff of judges
and to distribute the work among them. A natural
division was that ordinary pleas (or common pleas) should
be tried before one set of judges, and royal pleas (or
pleas of the Crown) before another. This distinction
is recognized in many separate chapters.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c017'><sup>[155]</sup></a> Thus two
groups of judges were formed, each of which was at first
rather a committee of the larger <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia</i></span> as a whole than
an independent tribunal; but, in later years, the two
rapidly developed into entirely separate courts—the Court
of Common Pleas (at first known as the Bench, that is,
the ordinary Bench), and the Court of King’s Bench
(that is, the royal Bench, known also at first as the
court <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Coram Rege</i></span>, since it was always supposed to be
held in the King’s presence).</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>c</i>) Special procedure for determining pleas of disputed
titles to land or rights of possession was also invented
by Henry to take the place of the ancient method of
trial by battle. These Assizes, as they were called, are
fully discussed elsewhere.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c017'><sup>[156]</sup></a> The Grand Assize was looked
on with suspicion by the barons as a procedure competent
only before the royal courts, and therefore closely
bound up with the King’s other devices for substituting
his own jurisdiction for that of the private courts. The
petty assizes, on the contrary, met with a ready acceptance,
and the barons in 1215, far from objecting to their continuance,
demanded that they should be held in regular
sessions four times a year in each county of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>These were the chief innovations which enabled Henry,
while instituting many reforms urgently required and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>gladly welcomed by the mass of his subjects, at the same
time to effect a revolution in the relations of royal justice
to feudal justice. As time went on, new royal writs and
remedies were being continually devised to meet new types
of cases; and litigants flocked more and more readily to
the King’s Courts, leaving the seignorial courts empty of
business and of fees. Nor was this the only grievance
of the barons. When one of their own number was
amerced or accused of any offence involving loss of
liberty or lands, he might be compelled by the Crown,
under Henry and his sons, to submit to have the
amercement assessed or the criminal proceedings conducted
by one of the new Benches (by a tribunal composed
of some four or five of the King’s officials), in
place of the time-honoured judgment of his peers assembled
in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Commune Concilium</i></span> (the predecessor of the modern
Parliament).</p>

<p class='c001'>Can we wonder that the barons objected to be amerced
and judged by their inferiors?<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c017'><sup>[157]</sup></a> Can we wonder that
they resented the complete though gradual supersession
of their own profitable jurisdictions by the royal courts?<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c017'><sup>[158]</sup></a>
or that they looked with suspicion on every new legal
development of the royal justice? Can we wonder that,
when they seemed to have King John for the moment
in their power, they demanded redress of this group of
grievances, as well as of those connected with arbitrary
increase of feudal burdens?</p>

<p class='c001'>The cause for wonder rather is that their demands in
this respect were not more sweeping and more drastic. It
was one thing for their fathers to have endured the
encroachments of so strong a King as Henry II.—far too
wise a statesman to show clearly whither his innovations
were ultimately tending, and (some lapses notwithstanding)
a just ruler on the whole, using his increased
prerogatives with moderation and for national ends. It
was quite another thing to endure the same encroachments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>(or worse) from an unpopular King like John, discredited
and in their power, who had neither disguised his arrogance
nor made good use of his prerogatives. Royal justice, as
dispensed by John, was in every way inferior to royal
justice as dispensed under his father’s vigilant eye. Yet
the exasperated barons, in the hour of their triumph,
actually accepted, and accepted cordially, one half of royal
justice; while they sought to abolish only the other half.
The chapters bearing on the question of jurisdiction may
thus be arranged in two groups, some reactionary, and
some favourable to Henry’s reforms. On the one hand, no
lord of a manor shall be robbed of his court by the King
evoking before the royal courts pleas between two freeholders
of the lord’s manor;<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c017'><sup>[159]</sup></a> no freeman shall be judged
or condemned by the King’s officials, but only before the
full body of his peers (that is, of his fellow earls and barons,
if he be an earl or baron, and of his fellow tenants of the
manor, if he holds of a mesne lord);<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c017'><sup>[160]</sup></a> earls and barons
must be amerced only by their equals.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c017'><sup>[161]</sup></a> On the other
hand, in prescribing remedies for various abuses connected
with numerous branches of legal procedure recently introduced
into the royal courts, the barons accepted by implication
this new procedure itself and the royal encroachments
implied therein. For example, the Crown’s right to hold
“Common Pleas” was impliedly admitted, when the barons
asked and obtained a promise that these should be tried in
some certain place (that is, at Westminster).<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c017'><sup>[162]</sup></a> Yet these
very pleas, ordinary ones in which the Crown had no
special interest, as opposed to Pleas of the Crown in which
it had, must have included many cases which, prior to
Henry II.’s reforms, would not have been tried in a royal
court. Again, in regulating the various Petty Assizes,
chapters 18 and 19 admit the Crown’s right to hold
them. Such Assizes must be taken henceforth four times
a year. Here, as in chapter 40, the ground of complaint is
not that there is too much of royal justice, but rather that
there is too little of it; it is henceforth to be neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>delayed nor denied. Further, the encroachments made
by Henry II. in 1166 on the rights of private franchises in
the matter of criminal jurisdiction are homologated by
acquiescence in the King’s definition of “Pleas of the
Crown” implied in chapter 24.</p>

<p class='c001'>These, then, are the two clearly contrasted groups into
which the innovations made by Henry and his sons, within
the province of justice, naturally fell as viewed by John’s
opponents in 1215: some of them had now come to be
warmly welcomed, and these, it was insisted, must be
continued by the Crown; while some of them still excited
as bitter opposition as ever, and these, it was insisted, must
be utterly swept away.</p>

support of recent writers, such as Maitland and Round, as well as of the

obvious case, where the claim was for the restoration of stolen cattle,
which had been traced by “hue and cry” to defendant’s house or byre.
The presumption of guilt was here so strong as to render corroborative
evidence unnecessary. The plaintiff’s unsupported oath was thus sufficient
to put the defendant on his “trial.” On the other hand, in the absence
alike of presumption and of witnesses swearing in support of plaintiff’s
oath, the defendant escaped without any “trial” at all.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>PART III. <br /> MAGNA CARTA: ITS FORM AND CONTENTS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'>I. Its Prototypes: Earlier Charters.</h3>

<p class='c016'>However wide and scattered were the sources from
which the substance of the Great Charter was derived,
its descent, on its formal side, can readily be traced,
through an unbroken line of antecedents, back to a very
early date. Magna Carta is directly descended from the
Charter of Liberties of Henry I., and that, again, was
a written supplement to the vows taken by that monarch
at his coronation, couched in similar terms to those
invariably sworn at their anointing by the Anglo-Saxon
kings of England, from Edgar to Edward Confessor.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ties which thus connect King John’s promises of
good government with the promises to the same effect
made at their coronation by the princes of the old dynasty
of Wessex are by no means of an accidental nature. Not
only is identity of substance, in part at least, maintained
throughout; but the promises were the outcome of an essential
feature of the old English constitution—a feature so
deeply rooted that it survived the shock of the Norman
Conquest. This feature, so fundamental and so productive
of great issues, was the elective or quasi-elective nature
of the monarchy. During the Anglo-Saxon era, two rival
principles, the elective and the hereditary, struggled for the
mastery in determining the succession to the Crown. In
an unsettled state of society, nations cannot allow the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>sceptre to pass into the hands of an infant or a weakling.
When a king died, leaving a son of tender age, and survived
by a brother of acknowledged ability and mature
powers, it was only natural that the latter should, in the
interests of peace and order, be preferred to the throne.
In such cases, the strict principle of primogeniture was
not followed. The magnates of the kingdom, the so-called
Witan, claimed the right to choose a fitting successor; yet
in so doing they usually paid as great regard to the
claims of kindred as circumstances permitted. The
exact relations between the elective and the hereditary
principles were never laid down with absolute precision.
Indeed, the want of definition in all constitutional
questions was characteristic of the age—a truth not
sufficiently apprehended by writers of the school of
Kemble and Freeman. The practice usually followed
by the Witenagemot was to select as the new ruler
some kinsman of the late king standing in close relationship
to him, and at the same time competent for
the high post. The king-elect thus appointed had, before
his title was complete, to undergo a further ceremony: he
required to be solemnly anointed by the representative of
the spiritual power, and this gave to the Church an
important share in deciding who should be king. At an
early date—exactly how early is not known, but certainly
not later than the days of Edgar—it became the invariable
practice for the officiating archbishop to exact an oath of
good government from the king-elect before his final
coronation. The precise terms of this oath became stereotyped;
and, as administered by Dunstan to King Ethelred,
they are still extant.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c017'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>It may be briefly analyzed into three promises—peace
to God’s Church and people; repression of violence in
men of every rank; justice and mercy in all judgments.
Such was the famous tripartite oath taken, after celebration
of mass, over the most sacred relics laid on the
high altar, in presence of Church and people, by the
kings of the old Anglo-Saxon race. When William I.,
anxious in all things to fortify the legality of his title,
took the oath in this solemn form, he created a precedent
of tremendous importance, although he may have regarded
it at the moment as an empty formality.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c017'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This step was doubly important: as a link with the
past, as a precedent for the future. A bridge was thus
thrown across the social and political gulf of the Norman
Conquest, preserving the continuity of the monarchy and
of the basis on which it was founded. The elective
character of the kingship, the need for coronation by
the Church, and (the natural supplement of both) this
tripartite oath containing promises of good government,
valuable though vague, were all preserved.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was of vital moment, because limits were thereby
placed, in theory at least, on prerogatives that threatened
in practice to become absolute. Undoubtedly the power
of the Norman kings was very great, and might almost be
described as irresponsible despotism, tempered by the fear
of rebellion. Three forces indeed acted as curbs: the practical
necessity for consulting the Curia Regis (or assembly
of crown vassals) before any vital step was taken; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>restraining influence of the national Church, backed by
the spiritual powers of Rome; and the growth, in a vague
form, it is true, of a body of public opinion confined as
yet to the upper classes.</p>

<p class='c001'>All these elements counted for something, but failed
to restrain sufficiently even an average king; while they
were powerless against a strong ruler like William I.
The only moment at which the Crown might be taken
at a clear disadvantage was during the interregnum which
followed the death of the last occupant of the throne. Two
or more rival heirs might aspire to the high position, and
would be eager to make promises in return for support.
Thus, William Rufus, at his father’s death, anxious to prevent
his elder brother, Duke Robert, from making good his
claim to the English throne, succeeded chiefly through
the friendship of Lanfranc. To gain this, he was compelled
to make promises of good government, and to follow
his father’s precedent by taking the oath in the ancient
form, in which it had been administered by Dunstan to
Ethelred. In the same reign began the practice of supplementing
verbal promises by sealed charters, which in
some respects must be regarded simply as the old coronation
oath confirmed, expanded, and reduced to writing.
No such charter was indeed issued either by Rufus or by
his father when they were crowned; but the younger
William, at a critical period later in his reign, seems to have
granted a short Charter of Liberties, the exact contents
of which have not come down to us. At the death of Rufus,
his younger brother, Henry I., found himself hard pressed
in the competition for the English Crown by Duke Robert
(the Conqueror’s eldest son). By a treaty made at Caen
in 1091, Duke Robert and Rufus had agreed that each
should constitute the other his heir. Thus Henry was,
in a sense, a usurper, and this circumstance made it
necessary for him to bid high for influential support.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c017'><sup>[165]</sup></a>
It is to this doubtful title, coupled with the knowledge
of widespread disaffection, that Englishmen owe the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>origin of the first Charter of Liberties that has come
down to us.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c017'><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This charter was the price paid by Henry for the support
he required in his candidature for the Crown. In
granting it he admitted, in a sense, the contractual basis of
his kingship. In discussing its tone and general tenor
there is ample room for differences of opinion. Dr. Stubbs<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c017'><sup>[167]</sup></a>
maintains that Henry thereby “definitely commits himself
to the duties of a national King.” Writers of almost equal
authority somewhat modify this view, holding that, although
circumstances forced Henry to pose as the leader of the
entire nation, yet nothing of this could be traced in the
charter, the basis of which seems to have been feudal
rather than national.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c017'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This view is strengthened by analysis of the actual
provisions of the charter. While important and definite
concessions were made to the Church and to the Crown-tenants,
those to the people at large were few and vague—so
vague as to be of little practical use. The Church, it
was declared, “should be free,” a wide phrase to which
these particulars were added, namely, that the wardship
of sees during vacancies should not be sold or hired out,
and that no sums should be demanded in name of reliefs
from the lands or tenants of a see when a death occurred.
The “baronage” (to use a convenient anachronism for “the
Crown-tenants considered collectively”) received redress of
their worst grievances in regard to reliefs and other
feudal obligations. In this respect Henry’s charter anticipated
and even went beyond some of the reforms of
1215.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c017'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is true that the mass of the people may have
indirectly benefited by many of these provisions; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>when we look for measures of a directly popular
character, only three can be found, namely, promises to
enforce peace in the land, to take away evil customs, and
to observe the laws of Edward Confessor as amended by
William I. This is too slender a basis on which to found
a claim to take rank as a “national king,” even if Henry
had any intention of keeping his promises. It is now
notorious that not a single promise remained unbroken.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c017'><sup>[170]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From another point of view the charter is a criticism on
the administration of Rufus (and to some extent also of
the Conqueror), combined with a promise of amendment.
Henry thus posed as a reformer, and forswore the evil
customs of his father and brother. The great value of the
charter, however, lies in this, that it is the first formal
acceptance (published under seal and in proper legal shape)
of the old law of Anglo-Saxon England by a ruler of the
new alien dynasty; yet in this Henry was only completing
what his father had begun. These considerations help to
account for the almost exaggerated importance attached to
Henry’s charter during the reign of John.</p>

<p class='c001'>If all efforts made to defeat Henry’s succession failed,
the succession of his daughter Matilda was disputed
triumphantly. Stephen, taking advantage of his cousin’s
absence and of her personal unpopularity, made a rapid
descent on England with the spasmodic energy which
characterized him, and successfully snatched the Crown.
Trained in English ways on English soil, he was quickly
on the spot and very popular. These features in his favour,
however, did not render his position entirely secure as
against the daughter and heiress of so strong a King as
Henry I., to whom, indeed, Stephen himself, with all the
magnates of England, had already thrice sworn allegiance.
He was only one of two competitors for the Crown, with
chances nearly equal. From the moment of the old King’s
death, “the Norman barons treated the succession as an
open question.” In these words of Bishop Stubbs,<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c017'><sup>[171]</sup></a> Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>J. H. Round finds<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c017'><sup>[172]</sup></a> the keynote of the reign. Stephen
was never secure on his throne, and had to make indiscriminate
promises first to obtain, and afterwards to
retain, his position. He was thus prepared to bid much
higher for support than Henry had felt compelled to do.
Adherents had to be gained painfully, one by one, by the
grant of special favours to every individual whose support
was worth the buying.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bargains were struck with the Londoners, with Stephen’s
brother Henry of Blois (Bishop of Winchester), with the
Keepers of the King’s Treasure, with the Archbishop of
Canterbury, and with the Justiciar (Bishop Roger of Salisbury).
The support of the two last mentioned carried
with it the support of the Church and of the administrative
staff of the late king, but was only gained by wide concessions.
Thus Stephen, like William of Orange, five
centuries later, agreed to become “king upon conditions.”
A Charter of Liberties and a solemn oath securing "the
liberty of the Church"—a vague phrase, it is true, but none
the less dangerous on that account—together formed the
price of Stephen’s consecration; and this price was not
perhaps too high when we remember that "election was
a matter of opinion, coronation a matter of fact"—a solemn
sacrament that could hardly be undone.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c017'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Even this important ceremony, however, left Stephen’s
throne a tottering one; he was compelled to buy the adherence
of powerful magnates by lavish concessions of land
and franchises; and various charters in favour of individual
nobles still exist as witnesses to such bribes. The process
by which he built up a title to the Crown seems to have
culminated in the Easter of 1136, when he secured the
support of Matilda’s half-brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>whose lead was quickly followed by other influential
nobles. All of these new adherents, however, performed
homage to the King under an important reservation,
namely, that their future loyalty would be strictly
conditional on the treatment extended to them by Stephen.
That unfortunate monarch accordingly, by tolerating such
conditional allegiance, was compelled to acknowledge the
inherent weakness of his position even in the moment
of his nominal triumph.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c017'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These important transactions took place apparently at
Oxford,<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c017'><sup>[175]</sup></a> and at the same time the King issued his second
or Oxford Charter, which embodied and expanded the contents
of earlier charters and oaths. This Oxford Charter,
the date of which has been proved to be early in
April,<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c017'><sup>[176]</sup></a> is noteworthy alike for the circumstances in
which it was granted, placing as it did the copestone
on the gradual process by which Stephen was “elected”
king, and also for its contents, which combined the earlier
oath to the Church and the vague, unsatisfactory earlier
charter to the people, with the new conditions extorted
by Earl Robert and his followers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The opening words, in which Stephen describes himself as
“King of the English,” may be read as a laboured attempt
to set forth a valid title to the throne. All reference
to predecessors is carefully avoided, and the usurper
declares himself to be king "by appointment of the clergy
and people, by consecration of the archbishop and papal
legate, and by the Pope’s confirmation."<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c017'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps its chief provisions are those in favour of the
Church, supplementing a vague declaration that the Church
should be “free” by specific promises that the bishops
should have exclusive jurisdiction and power over churchmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>and their goods, along with the sole right to superintend
their distribution after death. Here was a clear
confirmation of the right of the Courts Christian to a
monopoly of all pleas affecting the clergy or their property.
It is the first distinct enunciation in England of the principle
afterwards known as "benefit of clergy"—and that, too, in
a form more sweeping than was ever afterwards repeated.
Stephen also explicitly renounced all rights inherent in the
Crown to wardship over Church lands during vacancies—a
surrender never dreamed of by either Henry I. or Henry II.</p>

<p class='c001'>Grants to the people at large followed. A general clause
promising peace and justice was again supplemented
by specific concessions of more practical value, namely, a
promise to extirpate all exactions, unjust practices, and
“miskennings” by sheriffs and others, and to observe good,
ancient, and just customs in respect of murder-fines, pleas,
and other causes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Strangely enough, there is only one provision specially
benefiting feudal magnates, the King’s disclaimer of all
tracts of land afforested since the time of the two Williams.
The omission of further feudal concessions must not be
attributed either to Stephen’s strength, or to any spirit of
moderation or self-sacrifice in the magnates. Each baron of
sufficient importance had already extorted a special charter
in his own favour, more emphatic and binding from its
personal nature, and accordingly more valued than a mere
general provision in favour of all and sundry. Such private
grants generally included a confirmation of the grantee’s
right to maintain his own feudal stronghold, thus placing
him in a position of practical independence.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is instructive to compare these wide promises of
Stephen with the meagre words of the charter granted
by Henry of Anjou at or soon after his Coronation.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c017'><sup>[178]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Henry II. carefully omits all mention of Stephen and his
charters, not, as is sometimes supposed, because he did not
wish to acknowledge the existence of a usurper, but because
of that usurper’s lavish grants to the Church. Henry had
no intention either to confirm “benefit of clergy” in so
sweeping a form as Stephen had done, or to renounce wardship
over the lands of vacant sees.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the Church, as to the barons, Henry Plantagenet confirms
only what his grandfather had already conceded. Even
when compared with the standard set by the charter of
Henry I., that of the younger Henry is shorter and less
explicit, and therefore weaker and more liable to be set
aside—features which justified Stephen Langton in his
preference for the older document. If Henry II. granted a
short and grudging charter, neither of his sons, at their
respective coronations, granted any charter at all. Reasons
for the omission readily suggest themselves; the Crown had
grown strong enough to dispense with this unwelcome
formality, partly because of the absence of rival competitors
for the throne, and partly because of the perfection to which
the machinery of government had been brought. The
utmost which the Church could extract from Richard and
John as the price of their consecration was the renewal of
the three vague promises contained in the words of the
oath, now taken as a pure formality. The omission to
grant charters was merely one symptom of the diseases of
the body politic consequent on the overweening power of
the Crown, and proves how urgent was the need of some
such re-assertion of the nation’s liberties as came in 1215.</p>

<p class='c001'>John, at least, was not to be allowed to shake himself
free from the obligations of his oath, or from the promise to
confirm the ancient laws and customs of the land therein
contained. Stephen Langton, before absolving him from
the effects of his quarrel with Rome, compelled him to
renew the terms of the coronation oath.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c017'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Nor was this all; from a meeting held at St. Albans on
4th August, 1213, writs were issued in the King’s name to
the various sheriffs, bidding them observe the laws of
Henry I. and abstain from unjust exactions.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c017'><sup>[180]</sup></a> Three weeks
later (on 25th August), the production of a stray copy of
Henry’s charter is said, by Roger of Wendover, to have
made a startling impression on all present,<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c017'><sup>[181]</sup></a> and the
same charter was a second time produced at Bury St.
Edmunds, on 4th November, 1214, and was accepted by
the malcontents as a model which, modified and enlarged,
might serve as a basis for the redress of the grievances of
the reign.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c017'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is thus both excusable and necessary to place much
stress on this sequence of coronation oaths and charters, as
contributing both to the form and to the substance of the
Magna Carta of John. Yet the tendency to take too
narrow a view of the antecedents of the Great Charter must
be carefully guarded against. Many ingredients went to
the making of it. Numerous reforms of Henry II., whether
embodied or not in one or more of the ordinances or assizes
that have come down to us, must be reckoned among their
number, equally with those constitutional documents which
happen to be couched in the form peculiar to charters
granted under the king’s great seal. It is also necessary to
remember the special grants made by successive kings of
England to the Church, to London and other cities, and to
individual prelates and barons. In a sense, the whole previous
history of England went to the making of Magna
Carta. The sequence of coronation oaths and charters is
only one line of descent; the Great Charter of John can
trace its origin through many other lines of distinguished
ancestors.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>II. Magna Carta: its Form and Juridical Nature.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Much ingenuity has been expended, without adequate
return, in the effort to discover which particular category
of modern jurisprudence most exactly describes the Great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Charter of John. Is it an enacted law, or a treaty; the
royal answer to a petition; or a declaration of rights? Is
it a simple pact, bargain, or agreement between contracting
parties? Or is it a combination of two or more of these?
Something has been said in favour of almost every possible
view, perhaps more to the bewilderment than to the enlightenment
of students of history uninterested in legal
subtleties.</p>

<p class='c001'>The claim of Magna Carta to rank as a formal act of
legislation has been supported on the ground that it was
promulgated in what was practically a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commune concilium</i></span>.
King John, it is maintained, met in a national assembly
all the estates of his realm who were then endowed
with political rights, and these concurred with him in
the granting of Magna Carta. The consent of all who
claimed a share in the making or repealing of laws—archbishops,
bishops, abbots, earls, and crown-tenants, great
and small—entitles the Charter to rank as a regular
statute.</p>

<p class='c001'>Against this view, however, technical informalities may
be urged. Both the composition of the Council and the
procedure adopted there, were irregular. No formal writs
of summons had been issued, and, therefore, the meeting
was never properly constituted; many individuals with the
right and duty of attendance had no opportunity to be
present. Further, the whole proceedings were tumultuary;
the barons assembled in military array and compelled the
consent of John by turbulence and show of force. On
these grounds, modern jurisprudence, if appealed to, would
reject the claim of the Charter to be enrolled as an ordinary
statute.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, it may be argued that Magna Carta,
while something less than a law, is also something more.
A law made by the king in one national assembly might
be repealed by the king in another; whereas the Great
Charter was intended by the barons to be unchangeable.
It was granted to them and their heirs for ever; and, in
return, a price had been paid, namely, the renewal of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>allegiance—a fundamental condition of John’s continued
possession of the throne.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c017'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Magna Carta has also been frequently described as a
treaty. Such is the verdict of Dr. Stubbs.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c017'><sup>[184]</sup></a> “The Great
Charter, although drawn up in the form of a royal grant,
was really a treaty between the King and his subjects....
It is the collective people who really form the
other high contracting party in the great capitulation.”<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c017'><sup>[185]</sup></a>
This view receives some support from certain words
contained in chapter 63 of the Charter itself: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Juratum
est autem tam ex parte nostra quam ex parte baronum, quod
haec omnia supradicta bona fide et sine malo ingenio
observabuntur</i></span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not sufficient to urge against this theory, as is
sometimes done, that the concord was entered into in bad
faith by one or by both of the contracting parties. It
is quite true that the compromise it contained was accepted
merely as a cloak under which to prepare for war; yet
jurisprudence, in treating of formal documents granted
under seal, pays no attention to sincerity or insincerity,
but looks merely to the formal expression of consent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Interesting questions might also be raised as to how far it
is correct to extend to treaties the legal rule which declares
void or voidable all compacts and agreements induced by
force or fear. In a sense, every treaty which ends a great
war would fall under such condemnation, since the vanquished
nation always bows to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>force majeure</i></span>. Such claims
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>as the Great Charter may have to rank as a treaty are
not, therefore, necessarily weakened by John’s subsequent
contention that when granting it he was not a free agent.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, however, a more radical objection. A treaty is
a public act between two contracting powers, who must,
to meet the requirements of modern jurisprudence, be
independent States or their accredited agents; while John
and his opponents were merely fragments of one nation or
State, torn asunder by mutual fears and jealousies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some authorities discard alike the theory of legislation
and the treaty theory to make way for a third, namely,
that Magna Carta is merely a contract, pact, or private
agreement. M. Emile Boutmy is of this opinion. "Le
caractère de cet acte est aisé à définir.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c017'><sup>[186]</sup></a> Ce n’est pas précisément
un traité, puisqu’il n’y a pas ici deux souverainetés
légitimes ni deux nations en présence; ce n’est pas non
plus une loi; elle serait entachée d’irrégularité et de
violence; c’est un compromis ou un pacte."<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c017'><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Thus considered, the proudest act of the national drama
would take its place in the comparatively humble legal
category which includes such transactions as the hire of a
waggon or the sale of a load of corn. There are, however,
fatal objections to this theory also. It is difficult to see
how the plea of “force,” if sufficient (as M. Boutmy
urges) to render null the enactment of a public law, would
not be even more effective in reducing a private agreement.
If Magna Carta has no other basis than the declared
consent of the contracting parties, it seems safer to
describe it as a public treaty than as a private or civil
pact devoid of political significance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other theories also are possible; as, for example, that
the Great Charter is of the nature of a Declaration of
Rights, such as have played so prominent a part in the
political history of France and of the United States; while
a recent American writer on English constitutional development
seems almost to regard it as a code, creating a formal
constitution for England—in a rude and embryonic form,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>it is true. “If a constitution has for its chief object
the prevention of encroachments and the harmonizing of
governmental institutions, Magna Carta answers to that
description, at least in part.”<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c017'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It would be easy to find examples of attempts to compromise
between these competing theories, by combining
two or more of them. Thus, a high English authority
declares that “the Great Charter is partly a declaration
of rights, partly a treaty between Crown and people.”<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c017'><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The essential nature of what took place at Runnymede,
in June, 1215, is plain, when stripped of legal subtleties.
A bargain was struck between the King and the rebel
magnates, the purport of which was that the latter should
renew their oaths of fealty and homage, and give security
that they would keep these oaths, while John, in return,
granted “to the freemen of England and their heirs for
ever” the liberties enumerated in sixty-three chapters.
No one thought of asking whether the transaction thus
concluded was a “treaty” or a private “contract.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The terms of this bargain, however, had to be drawn
up in proper legal form, so as to bear record for all time
to the exact nature of the provisions therein contained, and
also to the authenticity of John’s consent thereto. It
was, therefore, reduced to writing, and the resulting
document was naturally couched in the form invariably
used for all irrevocable grants intended to descend from
father to son, namely, a feudal charter, authenticated by
the addition of a seal—just as in the case of a grant of
land, and with many of the clauses appropriate to such
a grant.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c017'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John grants to the freemen of England and their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>heirs certain specified rights and liberties, as though these
were merely so many hides or acres of land. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Concessimus
etiam omnibus liberis hominibus regni nostri, pro nobis
et haeredibus nostris in perpetuum, omnes libertates subscriptas,
habendas et tenendas, eis et haeredibus suis, de nobis
et haeredibus nostris.</i></span><a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c017'><sup>[191]</sup></a> The legal effect of such a grant is
hard to determine; and insuperable difficulties beset any
attempt to expound its legal consequences in terms of
modern law.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c017'><sup>[192]</sup></a> In truth, the form and substance of Magna
Carta are badly mated. Its substance consists of a
number of legal enactments and political and civil rights;
its form is borrowed from the feudal lawyer’s book of
styles for conferring a title to landed estate.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c017'><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>The results of this inquiry seem then to be completely
negative. It is useless to describe phenomena of the
thirteenth century in modern phraseology which would
have been unintelligible to contemporaries. Medieval
lawyers experienced great difficulties in trying to express
the actual facts of their day in terms of such categories
of the Roman jurisprudence as had survived the fall of
Rome and Roman civilization. There is no one of the
ancient or modern categories which can be applied with
confidence to the Great Charter or to the transaction of
which it is the record. Magna Carta may perhaps be
described as a treaty or a contract which enacts or proclaims
a number of rules and customs as binding in
England, and reduces them to writing in the unsuitable
form of a feudal charter granted by King John to the
freemen of England and their heirs.</p>

that “charter” should be followed by “infeftment” or delivery (real

John, and requiring confirmation by his son. Yet this also was in
strict accordance with feudal theory, which required the heir to complete

will hardly have prevented you from using in the privacy of your own
minds some such words as ‘inept’ or ‘childish.’ King John makes a
grant to the men of England and their heirs. The men of England
and their heirs are to hold certain liberties of that prince and his heirs
for ever. Imagine yourself imprisoned without the lawful judgment
of your peers, and striving to prove while you languish in gaol that
you are heir to one of the original grantees. Nowadays it is only
at a rhetorical moment that Englishmen ‘inherit’ their liberties, their
constitution, their public law. When sober, they do nothing of the
kind. But, whatever may have ‘quivered on the lip’ of Cardinal
Langton and the prelates and barons at Runnymead, the speech that
came was the speech of feoffment. Law, if it is to endure, must be
inherited. If all Englishmen have liberties, every Englishman has
something, some thing, that he can transmit to his heir. Public law
cannot free itself from the forms, the individualistic forms of private
law."</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III. Magna Carta: its Contents and Characteristics.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The confirmation of the rights enumerated in the sixty-three
chapters of the Charter represented the price paid
by John for the renewed allegiance of the rebels. These
rights are fully discussed, one by one, in the second part
of the present volume: a brief description of their more
prominent characteristics, when viewed as a collective
whole, is, therefore, all that is here required.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the attempt to analyze the leading provisions, various
principles of classification have been adopted. Three of
these stand out prominently: the various chapters may
be arranged according to the functions of the central
government which they were intended to limit; according
to their own nature as progressive, reactionary, or merely
declaratory; and, finally, according to the classes of the
community which reaped the greatest benefit.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <em>Provisions classified according to the various prerogatives
of the Crown which they affect.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Gneist<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c017'><sup>[194]</sup></a> adopts this principle of division, and
arranges the chapters of Magna Carta into five groups
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>according as they place legal limitations (1) on the
feudal military power of the Crown, (2) on its judicial
power, (3) on its police power, (4) on its financial power,
or (5) furnish a legal sanction for the enforcement of the
whole. In spite of Dr. Gneist’s high authority, it is doubtful
whether an analysis of Magna Carta upon these somewhat
arbitrary lines throws much light on its main objects
or results. Such a division, if convenient for some
purposes, seems artificial and unreal, since it is founded
on distinctions which were not clearly formulated in the
thirteenth century. The adoption of such a principle of
classification with reference to a period when the various
functions of the executive were still blended together
indiscriminately is somewhat of an anachronism.<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c017'><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>II. <em>Provisions classified according as they are of a progressive,
reactionary, or declaratory nature.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the many questions pressing for answer, none
seem more natural than those which inquire into the
relations between the promises made in the Charter and
the system of government actually at work under Henry
of Anjou and his sons; or the relations between these
promises and the still older laws of Edward Confessor.</p>

<p class='c001'>The view generally entertained is that the provisions
of Magna Carta are chiefly, if not exclusively, of a
declaratory nature. The Great Charter has for many
centuries been described as an attempt to confirm and
define existing customs rather than to change them. In
the words of Blackstone,<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c017'><sup>[196]</sup></a> writing in 1759, “It is agreed
by all our historians that the Great Charter of King John
was for the most part compiled from the ancient customs
of the realm, or the laws of King Edward the Confessor,
by which they usually mean the common law, which was
established under our Saxon princes, before the rigours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>of feudal tenures and other hardships were imported from
the continent.” Substantially the same doctrine has been
enunciated only the other day, by our highest authority.
"On the whole, the charter contains little that is absolutely
new. It is restorative. John in these last years has
been breaking the law; therefore the law must be defined
and set in writing.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c017'><sup>[197]</sup></a> This view seems, on the whole, a
correct one; the insurgents in 1215 professed to be
demanding nothing new, but merely a return to the
good laws of Edward Confessor, as supplemented by the
promises contained in the charter of Henry I. An unbroken
thread runs back from Magna Carta to the laws and
customs of Anglo-Saxon England and the old coronation
oaths of Ethelred and Edgar. Yet the Great Charter
contained much that was unknown to the days of the
Confessor and had no place in the promises of Henry I.
In many points of detail the Charter must look for its
antecedents rather to the administrative changes introduced
by Henry II. than to the old customary law that prevailed
before the Conquest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus it is not sufficient to describe Magna Carta merely
as a declaratory enactment; it is necessary to distinguish
between the different sources of what it declared. A
fourfold division may be suggested. (1) Magna Carta
embodied and handed down to future ages some of the
usages of the old customary law of Anglo-Saxon England,
unchanged by the Conqueror or his successors, now confirmed
and purified from abuses. (2) In defining feudal
incidents and services, it confirmed many rules of the
feudal law brought into England by the Normans subsequently
to 1066. (3) It also embodied many provisions
of which William I. and even Henry I. knew no more
than did the Anglo-Saxon kings—innovations introduced
for his own purposes by Henry of Anjou, but, after
half a century of experience, now accepted loyally even
by the most bitter opponents of the Crown. In the
words of Mr. Prothero, “We find ... the judicial and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>administrative system established by Henry II. preserved
almost intact in Magna Carta, though its abuse was carefully
guarded against.”<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c017'><sup>[198]</sup></a> Finally, (4) in some few points,
the Charter actually aimed at going farther than Henry II.,
great reformer as he was, had intended to go. Thus, to
mention only two particulars, the Petty Assizes are to
be taken in every county four times a year, while sheriffs
and other local magistrates are entirely prohibited from
holding pleas of the Crown.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are two further reasons why we cannot be content
with an explanation which dismisses Magna Carta with
the bald statement that its provisions are merely of a
declaratory nature. History has proved the universal
truth of the theory that a purely declaratory enactment
is impossible; since the mere lapse of time, by
producing an altered historical context, necessarily changes
the purport of any Statute when re-enacted in a later age.
Even if words identically the same are repeated, the new
circumstances read into them a new meaning. Such is
the case even when the framers of these re-enactments
are completely sincere, which, often, they are not. It is no
unusual device for innovators to render their reforms
more palatable by presenting them disguised as returns
to the past. Magna Carta affords many illustrations of
this. Its clauses, even where they profess to be merely
confirmatory of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>status quo</i></span>, in reality alter existing
custom.</p>

<p class='c001'>Further, it is of vital importance to bear in mind the
exact nature of the provisions confirmed or declared. A
re-statement of some of the more recent reforms of Henry II.
(or of those of Archbishop Hubert Walter, following in his
footsteps) leads logically to progress rather than to mere
stability; while the professed confirmation of Anglo-Saxon
usages or of ancient feudal customs, fast disappearing under
the new <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>régime</i></span>, implies retrogression rather than standing
still. Chapters 34 and 39 of Magna Carta, for example,
are of this latter kind. They really demand a return to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>the system in vogue prior to the innovations of Henry
II. when they declare in favour of feudal jurisdictions.
Thus, some of the provisions of the Great Charter which,
at a casual glance, appear to be correctly described as
declaratory, are, in reality, innovations; while others tend
towards reaction.</p>

<p class='c001'>III. <em>Provisions classified according to the estates of the
community in whose favour they were conceived.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>This third principle of arrangement would stand condemned
as completely misleading, if it were necessary to
accept as true, in any literal sense, the assertions so frequently
made concerning the absolute equality of all classes
and interests before the law—as that law was embodied in
Magna Carta. Here, then, we are face to face with a
fundamental question of immense importance: Does the
Great Charter really, as the orthodox traditional view so
vehemently asserts, protect the rights of the whole mass of
humble Englishmen equally with those of the proudest
noble? Is it really a great bulwark of the constitutional
liberties of the nation, considered as a nation, in any broad
sense of that word? Or is it rather, in the main, a series
of concessions to feudal selfishness wrung from the King
by a handful of powerful aristocrats? On such questions,
learned opinion is sharply divided, although an overwhelming
majority of authorities range themselves on the
popular side, from Coke (who assumes in every page
of his <cite>Second Institute</cite> that the rights won in 1215 were as
valuable for the villein as for the baron) down to writers
of the present day. Lord Chatham in one of his great
orations<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c017'><sup>[199]</sup></a> insisted that the barons who wrested the Charter
from John established claims to the gratitude of posterity
because they “did not confine it to themselves alone, but
delivered it as a common blessing to the whole people”;
and Sir Edward Creasy,<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c017'><sup>[200]</sup></a> in citing Chatham’s words with
approval, caps them with more ecstatic words of his own,
declaring that one effect of the Charter was “to give and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>to guarantee full protection for property and person to
every human being that breathes English air.” Lord Chatham
indeed spoke with the unrestrained enthusiasm of
an orator; yet staid lawyers and historians like Blackstone
and Hallam seem to vie with him in similar expressions.
“An equal distribution of civil rights to all classes of
freemen forms the peculiar beauty of the charter”; so
we are told by Hallam.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c017'><sup>[201]</sup></a> Bishop Stubbs unequivocally
enunciated the same doctrine. “Clause by clause the
rights of the commons are provided for as well as the
rights of the nobles.... This proves, if any proof were
wanted, that the demands of the barons were no selfish
exactions of privilege for themselves.”<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c017'><sup>[202]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Gneist is of the same opinion. “Magna Carta was
a pledge of reconciliation between all classes. Its existence
and ratification maintained for centuries the notion of
fundamental rights as applicable to all classes in the consciousness
that no liberties would be upheld by the superior
classes for any length of time, without guarantees of personal
liberties for the humble also.”<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c017'><sup>[203]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“The rights which the barons claimed for themselves,”
says John Richard Green,<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c017'><sup>[204]</sup></a> before proceeding to enumerate
them, “they claimed for the nation at large.” The
testimony of a very recent writer, Dr. Hannis Taylor,<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c017'><sup>[205]</sup></a>
may close this series. “As all three orders participated
equally in its fruits, the great act at Runnymede
was in the fullest sense of the term a national act, and
not a mere act of the baronage on behalf of their own
special privileges.” It would be easy to add to this “cloud
of witnesses,” but enough has been said to prove that it
has been a common boast of Englishmen, for many centuries,
that the provisions of the Great Charter were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>intended to secure, and did secure, the liberties of every
class and individual of the nation, not merely those of
the feudal magnates on whose initiative the quarrel was
raised.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must not be forgotten, however, that the truth of
historical questions does not depend on the counting of
votes, or the weight of authority; nor that a vigorous
minority has always protested on the other side. “It has
been lately the fashion,” Hallam confesses, “to depreciate
the value of Magna Charta, as if it had sprung from the
private ambition of a few selfish barons, and redressed
only some feudal abuses.”<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c017'><sup>[206]</sup></a> It is not safe to accept, without
a careful consideration of the evidence, the opinions
cited even from such high authorities. “Equality” is
essentially a modern ideal: in 1215, the various estates of
the realm may have set out on the journey which was
ultimately to lead them to this conception, but they had
not yet reached their goal. For many centuries after the
thirteenth, class legislation maintained its prominent place
on the Statute Rolls, and the interests of the various
classes were by no means always identical.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two different parts of the Charter have a bearing on
this question; namely, chapter 1, which explains to
whom the rights were granted, and chapter 61, which
declares by whom they were to be enforced. John’s
words clearly tell us that the liberties were confirmed “to
all freemen of my kingdom and their heirs for ever.”
This opens up the crucial question—who were <em>freemen</em> in
1215?</p>

<p class='c001'>The enthusiasm, natural and even laudable in its proper
place, although fatal to historical accuracy in its results,
which seeks to enhance the merits of Magna Carta by
exalting its provisions and extending their scope as widely
as possible, has led commentators to stretch the meaning
of “freeman” to its utmost limits. The word has even
been treated as embracing the entire population of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>England, including not only churchmen, merchants, and
yeomen, but even villeins as well. There are reasons,
however, for believing that it should be understood in
a sense much more restricted, although the subject is
darkened by the vagueness of the word, and by the
difficulty of determining whether it bears any technical
signification or not. “Homo,” in medieval law-Latin,
has a peculiar meaning, and was originally used as
synonymous with "baro"—all feudal vassals, whether of
the Crown or of mesne lords, being described as “men” or
“barons.” The word was sometimes indeed more loosely
used, as may have been the case in chapter 1. Yet
Magna Carta is a feudal charter, and the presumption
is in favour of the technical feudal meaning of the word—a
presumption certainly not weakened by the addition
of an adjective confining it to the “free.” This qualifying
word certainly excluded villeins, and possibly
also the great burgess class, or many of them. There
is a passage in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dialogus de Scaccario</cite></span> (dating from the
close of the reign of Henry II.), in which Richard Fitz-Nigel
reckons even the richest burgesses and traders as
not fully free. He discusses the legal position of any
knight (<em>miles</em>) or other freeman (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liber homo</i></span>) losing his
status by engaging in commerce in order to make money.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c017'><sup>[207]</sup></a>
This does not prove that rich townsmen were ranked
with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>villani</i></span> of the rural districts; but it does
raise a serious doubt whether in the strict legal language
of feudal charters the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liberi homines</i></span> would be
interpreted by contemporary lawyers as including the
trading classes. Such doubts are strengthened by a narrow
scrutiny of those passages of the Charter in which the
term occurs. In chapter 34 the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liber homo</i></span> is, apparently,
assumed to be a landowner with a private manorial
jurisdiction of which he may be deprived. In other words,
he is the holder of a freehold estate of some extent—a
great barony or, at the least, a manor. In this part of
the Charter the “freeman” is clearly a county gentleman.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Is the “freeman” of chapter 1 something different?
The question must be considered an open one; but much
might be said in favour of the opinion that “freeman”
as used in the Charter is synonymous with “freeholder”;
and that therefore only a limited class could, as
grantees or the heirs of such, make good a <em>legal</em> claim
to share in the liberties secured by Magna Carta.<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c017'><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To the question, who had authority to enforce its provisions,
the Great Charter has likewise a clear answer,
namely, a select band or quasi-committee of twenty-five
barons. Although the Mayor of London was chosen
among their number, it is clear that no strong support
for any democratic interpretation of Magna Carta can be
founded on the choice of executors; since these formed
a distinctly aristocratic body. Yet this tendency to vest
power exclusively in an oligarchy composed of the heads
of great families may have been counteracted, so it is
possible to contend, by the invitation extended by the
same chapter to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>communa totius terrae</i></span> to assist the
twenty-five Executors against the King in the event
of his breaking faith. Unfortunately, the extreme vagueness
of the phrase makes it rash in a high degree to build
conclusions on such foundations. It is possible to interpret
the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>communa totius terrae</i></span> as applying merely to
“the community of freeholders of the land,” or even to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“the community of barons of the land,” as well as to
“the community of all the estates (including churchmen,
merchants, and commons) of the land,” as is usually done
on no authority save conjecture. Every body of men was
known in the thirteenth century as a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>communa</i></span>; a word
of exceedingly loose connotation.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far, our investigations by no means prove that the
equality of all classes, or the equal participation by all
in the privileges of the Charter, was an ideal, consciously or
unconsciously, held by the leaders of the revolt against King
John. Magna Carta itself contains evidences which point
the other way, namely, to the existence of class legislation.
At the beginning and end of the Charter, clauses are carefully
inserted to secure to the Church its “freedom” and
privileges; churchmen, in their special interests, must be
safeguarded, whoever else may suffer. “Benefit of clergy,”
thus secured, implies the very opposite of “equality before
the law.” Other interests also receive separate and privileged
treatment. Many, perhaps most, of the chapters
have no value except to landowners; a few affect tradesmen
and townsmen exclusively, while chapters 20 to 22
adopt distinct sets of rules for the amercement of the
ordinary freeman, the churchman, and the earl or baron
respectively—an anticipation, almost, of the later division
into the three estates of the realm—commons, clergy,
and lords temporal. A careful distinction is occasionally
made (for example, in chapter 20) between the freeman
and the villein, and the latter (as will be proved later
on) was carefully excluded from many of the benefits
conferred on others by Magna Carta. In this connection,
it is interesting to consider how each separate class
would have been affected if John’s promises had been
loyally kept.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <em>The Feudal Aristocracy.</em> Even a casual glance at the
clauses of the Great Charter shows how prominently abuses
of feudal rights and obligations bulked in the eyes of its
promoters. Provisions of this type must be considered
chiefly as concessions to the feudal aristocracy—although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>it is true that the relief primarily intended for them
indirectly benefited other classes as well.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <em>Churchmen.</em> The position of the Church is easily
understood when we neglect the privileges enjoyed by its
great men <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quâ</i></span> barons rather than <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quâ</i></span> prelates. The
special Church clauses found no place whatsoever in the
Articles of the Barons, but bear every appearance of having
been tacked on as an after-thought, due probably to the
influence of Stephen Langton.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c017'><sup>[209]</sup></a> Further, they are mainly
confirmatory of the separate Charter already twice granted
within the few preceding months. The National Church
indeed, with all its patriotism, had been careful to
secure its own selfish advantage before the political crisis
arrived.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <em>Tenants of Mesne Lords.</em> When raising troops with
the object of compelling John to grant Magna Carta by
parade of armed might, the barons were perforce obliged to
rely on the loyal support of their own freeholders. It was
essential that the knights and others who held under them
should be ready to fight for their mesne lords rather than
for the King their lord paramount. It was thus absolutely
necessary that these under-tenants should receive some
recognition of their claims in the provisions of the final
settlement. Concessions conceived in their favour are contained
in two clauses (couched apparently in no specially
generous spirit), namely, chapters 15 and 60. The former
limits the number of occasions on which aids might be
extorted from sub-tenants by their mesne lords to the
same three as were recognized in the case of the Crown.
Less than this the barons could scarcely have granted.
Chapter 60 provides generally, in vague words, that all the
customs and liberties which John agrees to observe towards
his vassals shall be also observed by mesne lords, whether
prelates or laymen, towards their sub-vassals. This provision
has met with a chorus of applause from modern
writers. Prof. Prothero declares<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c017'><sup>[210]</sup></a> that “the sub-tenant
was in all cases as scrupulously protected as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>tenant-in-chief.” Dr. Hannis Taylor<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c017'><sup>[211]</sup></a> is even more enthusiastic.
“Animated by a broad spirit of generous
patriotism, the barons stipulated in the treaty that every
limitation imposed for their protection upon the feudal
rights of the king should also be imposed upon their rights
as mesne lords in favour of the under-tenants who held of
them.”<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c017'><sup>[212]</sup></a> It must, however, be remembered that a vague
general clause affords less protection than a definite specific
privilege; and that in a rude age such a general declaration
of principle might readily be infringed when occasion
arose. The barons were compelled to do something, or to
pretend to do something, for their under-tenants. Apparently
they did as little as they, with safety or decency,
could.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) Something was also done for the <em>merchant and trading
classes</em>, but, when we subtract what has been read into
the Charter by democratic enthusiasts of later ages, not
so much as might reasonably be expected in a truly
national document. The existing privileges of the great
city of London were confirmed, without specification, in the
Articles of the Barons; and some slight reforms in favour
of its citizens (not too definitely worded) were then added.
An attentive examination seems to suggest, however, that
these privileges were carefully refined away when the
Articles were reduced to their final form in Magna Carta.
The right to tallage London and other towns was carefully
reserved to the Crown, while the rights of free trading
granted to foreigners were clearly inconsistent with
the policy of monopoly and protection dear to the hearts
of the Londoners. A mere confirmation to the citizens of
existing customs, already bought and paid for at a great
price, seems but a poor return for the support given by
them to the movement of insurrection at a critical moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>when John was bidding high on the opposite side, and
when their adherence was sufficient to turn the scale. The
marvel is that so little was done for them.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c017'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(5) The relation of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>villein</i></span> to the benefits of the
Charter has been hotly discussed. Coke claims for him, in
regard to the important provisions of chapter 39 at least,
that he must be regarded as a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liber homo</i></span>, and therefore
as a full participant in all the advantages of the clause.<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c017'><sup>[214]</sup></a>
This contention is not well founded. Even admitting the
relativity of the word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liber</i></span> in the thirteenth century, and
admitting also that the villein performed some of the duties,
if he enjoyed none of the rights of the free-born, still the
formal description <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liber homo</i></span>, when used in a feudal charter,
cannot be stretched to cover those useful manorial chattels
that had no recognized place in the feudal scheme of society
or in the political constitution of England, however necessary
they might be in the scheme of the particular manor
to the soil of which they were attached.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even if we exclude the villein from the general benefits
of the grant, it may be, and has been, maintained that
some few privileges were insured to him in his own name.
One clause at least is specially framed for his protection.
The villein, so it is provided in chapter 21, must not be so
cruelly amerced as to leave him utterly destitute; his
plough and its equipment must be saved to him.
Such concessions, however, are quite consistent with
a denial of all <em>political</em> rights, and even of all <em>civil</em>
rights, as these are understood in a modern age. The
Crown and the magnates, so it may be urged, were only
consulting their own interests when they left the villein
the means to carry on his farming operations, and so to
pay off the balance of his debts in the future. The closeness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>of his bond to the lord of his manor made it impossible
to crush the one without slightly injuring the other.
The villein was protected, not as the acknowledged subject
of legal rights, but because he formed a valuable asset of
his lord. This attitude is illustrated by a somewhat
peculiar expression used in chapter 4, which prohibited
injury to the estate of a ward by “waste of men or
things.” For a guardian to raise a villein to the status
of a freeman was to benefit the enfranchised peasant at
the expense of his young master.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c017'><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Other clauses both of John’s Charter and of the various
re-issues show scrupulous care to avoid infringing the
rights of property enjoyed by manorial lords over their
villeins. The King could not amerce other people’s villeins
harshly, although those on his own farms might be amerced
at his discretion. Chapter 16, while carefully prohibiting
any arbitrary increase of service from freehold property,
leaves by inference all villein holdings unprotected.
Then the “farms” or rents of ancient demesne might be
arbitrarily raised by the Crown,<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c017'><sup>[216]</sup></a> and tallages might be
arbitrarily taken (measures likely to press hardly on the
villein class). The villein was deliberately left exposed
to the worst forms of purveyance, from which chapters
28 and 30 rescued his betters. The horses and implements
of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>villanus</i></span> were still at the mercy of the Crown’s
purveyors. The re-issue of 1217 confirms this view; while
demesne waggons were protected, those of villeins were left
exposed.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c017'><sup>[217]</sup></a> Again, the chapter which takes the place of
the famous chapter 39 of 1215<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c017'><sup>[218]</sup></a> makes it clear that
lands held in villeinage are not to be protected from
arbitrary disseisin or dispossession. The villein was
left by the common law merely a tenant-at-will—subject
to arbitrary ejectment by his lord—whatever meagre
measure of protection he might obtain under the “custom
of the manor” as interpreted by the court of the lord
who oppressed him.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Even if it were possible to neglect the significance
of any one of these somewhat trivial points, when all
of them are placed side by side their meaning is clear.
If the bulk of the English peasantry were protected
at all by Magna Carta that was merely because they
formed valuable assets of their lords. The Charter
viewed them as "villeins regardant"—as chattels attached
to a manor, not as members of an English commonwealth.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c017'><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The general conclusion to be derived from this survey
is that, while much praise may be due to the baronial
leaders for their comparatively liberal interest in the rights
of others, they are scarcely entitled to the excessive laudation
they have sometimes received. The rude beginnings
of many features which have since come into prominence
in English institutions (such as the conceptions of patriotism
and nationality and the principles of equality before the law
and the tender regard for the rights of the humble) may
possibly be found in the germ in some parts of the completed
Charter; but the Articles of the Barons were what
their name implies, a baronial manifesto, seeking chiefly to
redress the private grievances of the promoters, and mainly
selfish in motive.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, when all deductions have been made (and it has
seemed necessary to do this with emphasis in order to
redress the false balance created by the exaggerations of
enthusiasts), the Great Charter still stands out as a prominent
landmark in the sequence of events which have
led, in an unbroken chain, to the consolidation of the
English nation, and to the establishment of a free and constitutional
form of polity upon a basis so enduring that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>after more than eight centuries of growth, it still retains
the vigour and the buoyancy of youth.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r208'>208</a>. In addition to its appearance in the two places mentioned in the text,
the word “freeman” appears in five other chapters, namely 15, 20,
27, 30, and 39. The three last instances throw no light on the meaning
of the word, since the context of each would be satisfied either with a
broader or with a narrower interpretation. It is different, however, with
chapter 15, where the freemen are necessarily the feudal tenants of a
mesne lord—that is, freeholders; and with chapter 20, where, in the
matter of amercement, the freeman is distinctly contrasted with the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>villanus</i></span>. Further, where men of servile birth are clearly meant, they
are described generally as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>probi homines</i></span> (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>e.g.</i></span> in chapters 20, 29, and 48),
and in one place, chapter 26, as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>legales homines</i></span>. Chapter 44 mentions
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>homines</i></span> without any qualification. It seems safe to infer that the
Great Charter never spoke of “freemen” when it meant to include the
ordinary peasantry or villagers. In chapter 39 of the re-issue of 1217,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liber homo</i></span> is clearly used as synonymous with “freeholder.”</p>

grievances to redress than members of other classes, and (2) that they
participated in all the grants from which they were not specially excluded.
“It was not that they had no spokesman, but that they were free from the
more pressing grievances, and benefited from every general provision.”

<h3 class='c015'>IV. Magna Carta: an Estimate of its Value.</h3>

<p class='c016'>No evidence survives to show that the men of John’s
reign placed any excessive or exaggerated importance on
the Great Charter; but, without a break since then,
the estimate of its worth steadily increased until it came
to be regarded almost as a fetish among English lawyers
and historians. No estimate of its value can be too high,
and no words too emphatic or glowing to satisfy its
votaries. In many a time of national crisis, Magna Carta
has been confidently appealed to as a fundamental law
too sacred to be altered—as a talisman containing some
magic spell, capable of averting national calamity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Are these estimates of its value justified by facts, or
are they gross exaggerations? Did it really create an
epoch in English history? If so, wherein did its importance
exactly lie?</p>

<p class='c001'>The numerous factors which contributed towards the
worth of Magna Carta may be distinguished as of two
kinds, intrinsic and extrinsic. (1) Its intrinsic value
depends on the nature of its own provisions. The reforms
demanded by the barons and granted by this
Charter were just and moderate. The avoidance of all
extremes tended towards a permanent settlement, since
moderation both gains and keeps adherents. Its aims
were practical as well as moderate; the language in
which they were framed, clear and straightforward. A
high authority has described the Charter as “an intensely
practical document.”<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c017'><sup>[220]</sup></a> This <em>practicality</em> is an essentially
English characteristic, and strikes the key-note of almost
every great movement for reform which has held a permanent
place in English history. Closely connected with
this feature is another—the essentially <em>legal</em> nature
of the whole. As Magna Carta was rarely absent from
the minds of subsequent opponents of despotism, a practical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>and legal direction was thus given to the efforts of
Englishmen in many ages.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c017'><sup>[221]</sup></a> Therein lies another English
characteristic. While democratic enthusiasts in France
and America have often sought to found their rights and
liberties on a lofty but unstable basis of philosophical
theory embodied in Declarations of Rights; Englishmen
have occupied lower but surer ground, aiming at practical
remedies for actual wrongs, rather than enunciating theoretical
platitudes with no realities to correspond.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another intrinsic merit of the Charter was that it
made definite what had been vague before. Definition
is a valuable protection for the weak against the strong;
whereas vagueness increases the powers of the tyrant
who can interpret while he enforces the law. Misty rights
were now reduced to a tangible form, and could no longer
be broken with so great impunity. Magna Carta contained
no crude innovations, and confirmed many principles
whose value was enhanced by their antiquity. King John,
in recognising parts of the old Anglo-Saxon customary
law, put himself in touch with national traditions and the
past history of the nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Further, the nature of the provisions bears witness
to the broad basis on which the settlement was intended
to be built. The Charter, notwithstanding the prominence
given to redress of feudal grievances, redressed other
grievances as well. In this, the influence of the Church
and notably of its Primate, can be traced. Some little
attention was given to the rights of the under-tenants also,
and even to those of the merchants, while the villein and
the alien were not left entirely unprotected. Thus the
settlement contained in the Charter had a broad basis in
the affection of all classes.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) Part of the value of Magna Carta may be traced to
extrinsic causes; to the circumstances which gave it birth—to
its vivid historical setting. The importance of each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>one of its provisions is emphasized by the object-lessons
which accompanied its inauguration. The whole of Christendom
was amazed by the spectacle of the King of a
great nation obliged to surrender at discretion to his own
subjects, and that, too, after he had scornfully rejected all
suggestions of a compromise. The fact that John was
compelled to accept the Charter meant a loss of royal
prestige, and also great encouragement to future rebels.
What once had happened, might happen again; and the
humiliation of the King was stamped as a powerful image
on the minds of future generations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such considerations almost justify enthusiasts, who hold
that the granting of Magna Carta was the turning-point
in English history. Henceforward it was more difficult
for the king to invade the rights of others. Where
previously the vagueness of the law lent itself to evasion,
its clear re-statement and ratification in 1215 pinned
down the king to a definite issue. He could no longer
plead that he sinned in ignorance; he must either keep
the law, or openly defy it—no middle course was possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>When all this has been said, it may still be
doubted whether the belief of enthusiasts in the excessive
importance of Magna Carta has been fully
justified. Many other triumphs, almost equally important,
have been won in the cause of liberty, and under circumstances
almost equally notable; and many statutes
have been passed embodying these. Why then should
Magna Carta be invariably extolled as the palladium of
English liberties? Is not, when all is said, the extreme
merit attributed to it mainly of a sentimental or imaginative
nature? Such questions must be answered partly
in the affirmative. Much of its value <em>does</em> depend on
sentiment. Yet all government is, in a sense, founded
upon sentiment—sometimes affection, sometimes fear.
Psychological considerations are all-powerful in the practical
affairs of life. Intangible and even unreal phenomena
have played an important part in the history of every
nation. The tie that binds the British colonies at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>present day to the Mother Country is largely one of
sentiment; yet the troopers from Canada and New Zealand
who responded to the call of Britain in her hour of need
produced practical results of an obvious nature. The
element of sentiment in politics can never be ignored.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is no disparagement to Magna Carta, then, to confess
that part of its power has been read into it by later
generations, and lies in the halo, almost of romance, which
has gradually gathered round it in the course of centuries.
It became a battle cry for future ages, a banner, a rallying
point, a stimulus to the imagination. For a king, thereafter,
openly to infringe the promises contained in the Great
Charter, was to challenge the bitterness of public opinion—to
put himself palpably in the wrong. For an aggrieved
man, however humble, to base his rights upon its terms
was to enlist the warm sympathy of all. Time and again,
from the Barons’ War against Henry III. to the days of
John Hampden and Oliver Cromwell, the possibility of
appealing to the words of Magna Carta has afforded a
practical ground for opposition; an easily intelligible principle
to fight for; a fortified position to hold against the
enemies of the national freedom. The exact way in which
this particular document—dry as its details at first sight
may seem—has, when considered as a whole, fired the
popular imagination, is difficult to determine. Such a
task lies rather within the sphere of the student of
psychology than of the student of history, as usually conceived.
However difficult it may be to explain this phenomenon,
there is no doubt of its existence. The importance
of the Great Charter, originally flowing both from the intrinsic
and from the extrinsic features already described,
has greatly increased, as traditions, associations, and
aspirations have clustered more thickly round it. These
have augmented in each succeeding age the reverence in
which it has been held, and have made ever more secure
its hold upon the popular imagination.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus Magna Carta, in addition to its legal value, has
a political value of an equally emphatic kind. Apart from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>and beyond the salutary effect of the many useful laws it
contained, its moral influence has contributed to a marked
advance of the national spirit, and therefore of the national
liberties. A few of the aspects of this advance deserve to
be emphasized. The King, by granting the Charter in
solemn form, admitted that he was not an absolute ruler—admitted
that he had a master over him in the laws which
he had often violated, but which he now swore to obey.
Magna Carta has thus been truly said to enunciate and
inaugurate “the reign of law” or “the rule of law” in
the phrase made famous by Professor Dicey.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c017'><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It marks also the commencement of a new grouping of
political forces in England; indeed without such a rearrangement
the winning of the Charter would have been
impossible. Throughout the reign of Richard I. the old
tacit understanding between the king and the lower classes
had been endangered by the heavy drain of taxation; but the
actual break-up of the old alliance only came in the crisis
of John’s reign. Henceforward can be traced a gradual
change in the balance of parties in the commonwealth. No
longer are Crown and people united, in the name of law and
order, against the baronage, standing for feudal disintegration.
The mass of humble freemen and the Church are for
the moment in league with the barons, in the name of law
and order, against the Crown, recently become the chief
law-breaker.</p>

<p class='c001'>The possibility of the existence of such an alliance, even
on a temporary basis, involved the adoption by its chief
members of a new baronial policy. Hitherto each great
baron had aimed at his own independence or aggrandisement,
striving on the one hand to gain new franchises for
himself, or to widen the scope of those he already had,
and on the other to weaken the king and to keep him outside
these franchises. This policy, which succeeded both in
France and in Scotland, had before John’s reign already
failed signally in England, and the English barons now, on
the whole, came to admit the hopelessness of renewing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>struggle for feudal independence. They substituted for
this ideal of an earlier age a more progressive policy. The
king, whose interference they could no longer hope completely
to shake off, must at least be taught to interfere
justly and according to rule; he must walk only by law and
custom, not by the caprices of his evil heart. The barons
sought henceforward, to control the royal power they
could not exclude; they desired some determining share
in the national councils, if they could no longer hope to
create little nations of their own within the four corners of
their fiefs. Magna Carta was the fruit of this new policy.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been often repeated, and with truth, that the
Great Charter marks also a stage in the growth of national
unity or nationality. Here, however, it is necessary to
guard against exaggeration. It is merely one movement
in a process, rather than a final achievement. We must
somewhat discount, while still agreeing in the main with,
statements which declare the Charter to be “the first
documentary proof of the existence of a united English
nation”; or with the often-quoted words of Dr. Stubbs,
that “The Great Charter is the first great public act of
the nation, after it has realised its own identity.”<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c017'><sup>[223]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A united English nation, whether conscious or <a id='corr149.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='unconcious'>unconscious</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_149.23'><ins class='correction' title='unconcious'>unconscious</ins></a></span>
of its identity, cannot be said to have existed in
1215, except under several qualifications. The conception
of “nationality,” in the modern sense, is of comparatively
recent origin, and requires that the lower as well as the
higher classes should be comprehended within its bounds.
Further, the coalition which wrested the Charter from the
royal tyrant was essentially of a temporary nature, and
quickly fell to pieces again. Even while the alliance continued,
the interests of the various classes, as has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>already shown, were far from identical. Political rights
were treated as the monopoly of the few (as is evidenced
by the retrograde provisions of chapter 14 for the composition
of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Commune concilium</cite></span>); and civil rights were far
from universally distributed. The leaders of the “national”
movement certainly gave no <em>political</em> rights to the despised
villeins, who comprised more than three quarters of the
entire population of England; while their <em>civil</em> rights were
almost completely ignored in the provisions of the Charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Magna Carta undoubtedly marked one step, an important
step, in the process by which England became a nation; but
that step was neither the first nor yet the final one.</p>

<p class='c001'>V. Magna Carta. Its defects.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great weakness of the Charter lay in this, that no
adequate sanction was attached to it, in order to ensure the
enforcement of its provisions. The only expedient suggested
for compelling the King to keep his promises was of
a nature at once clumsy and revolutionary, and entirely
worthless considered as a working scheme of government.
Indeed, it was devised not so much to prevent the King
from breaking faith as to punish him when he had done so.
In other words, no proper constitutional machinery was
invented to turn the legal theories of Magna Carta into
practical realities. In its absence, we find what has sometimes
been described as “a right of legalized rebellion”
conferred on an executive committee of twenty-five of the
King’s enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the chief defect, but not the only one. Many
minor faults and omissions may be traced to a similar root.
All the great constitutional principles are in reality conspicuously
absent. The importance of a council or embryo
parliament, constituted on truly national lines (of which
some glimmerings can be traced in 1213); the right of
such a body to influence the King’s policy in normal times
as well as in times of crisis; the doctrine of ministerial
responsibility (already dimly foreshadowed in the reign of
Richard); the need of distinguishing the various functions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of government, legislative, judicial, and administrative—all
these cardinal principles are completely ignored by the
Charter. Not one of its many clauses affords evidence that
the statesmen of the day had any conception, even of a
rudimentary nature, of the principles of political science.</p>

<p class='c001'>Only five of the sixty-three chapters can be said to bear
directly on the subject of constitutional (as opposed to
purely legal) machinery, and most of these do so only incidentally,
namely, chapters 14, 21, 39, 61, and 62.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Commune Concilium</cite></span> is indeed mentioned; and its
composition and mode of summons are clearly defined in
chapter 14. But it must be remembered that this chapter
appears as a mere afterthought,—as an appendix to
chapter 12; its incidental nature is proved by the fact
that it has no counterpart in the Articles of the Barons.
The rebel magnates were vitally interested in the narrow
question of scutage, not in the wide possibilities involved in
the existence of a national council. The <i>Commune Concilium</i>
was dragged into the Charter, not on its own
merits, but merely as a convenient method of preventing
the arbitrary increase of feudal exactions. That this was
so, is further proved by the fact that both parties were
content to omit all mention of the Council from the re-issue
of 1217, when an alternative way of checking the arbitrary
increase of scutage had been devised.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the framers of John’s Magna Carta had possessed any
grasp of constitutional principles, they would gladly have
seized the opportunity afforded them by the mention, however
incidentally, of the Common Council, in chapters 12 and
14, in order to define most carefully the powers which
they claimed for it. On the contrary, no list of its
functions is drawn up; nor do the words of the Charter contain
anything to suggest that it exercised any powers other
than that of consenting to scutages and aids. Not a word
is said of any right inherent in the Council to a share
in legislation, to control or even to advise the Executive,
or to concur in choosing the great ministers of the Crown.
Neither deliberative, administrative, nor legislative powers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>are secured to it, while its control over taxation is strictly
limited to the right to veto scutages and aids—that is
say, it only extends over that very narrow class of
exactions which affected the military tenants of the Crown.
It is true that chapters 21 and 39 may possibly be read
confirming the <i>judicial</i> power of the Council in a certain
limited group of cases. Earls and barons are not to be
amerced except by their peers (<i>per pares suos</i>), and the
natural place for these “equals” of a Crown vassal to
assemble for this purpose would be the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Commune Concilium</cite></span>.
This, however, is merely matter of inference; chapter 21
makes no mention of the Council; and it is equally
possible that its requirements would be met by the presence
among the officials of the Exchequer of a few
Crown tenants.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c017'><sup>[224]</sup></a> Similar reasoning applies to the provisions
of chapter 39 (protecting the persons and property
of freemen, by insisting on the necessity of a “trial by
peers”) so far as they affect earls and barons.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is clear that the leaders of the opposition in 1215
did not consider the constitutional powers of a national
Parliament the best safeguard of the rights and liberties
theoretically guaranteed by the Charter. Only one practical
or constitutional expedient seems to have occurred to
them, namely, that embodied in chapter 61. Twenty-five
barons were to be appointed by their fellow-barons to
act as Executors of the Charter; but their functions
were apparently only to be called into play in the event
of King John or his officers breaking any of the provisions
of the Charter. If this occurred, intimation might
be made to a smaller sub-committee of four, chosen from
the twenty-five, and these four would straightway ask the
King to redress the grievance complained of. If this was
not done within forty days, John granted to the Committee
of twenty-five, assisted by “the whole community of the
realm,” the right practically to make war upon him. He
conferred on them in the most explicit terms full power
“to distrain and distress us in all possible ways, by seizing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>our castles, lands, possessions, and in any other way they
can, until the grievances are redressed according to their
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such a provision can hardly be described as constitutional,
since it is rather the negation of all constitutional
principles—nothing more nor less than legalized rebellion.
Provision is made not for the orderly conduct
of government, but rather to provide an organization for
making war upon the king in certain abnormal circumstances
which are defined. Such a scheme was clearly
impracticable, and the fact that it recommended itself as
a possible expedient to the barons speaks eloquently of
their complete ignorance of the most elementary principles
of the science of government. Civil war levied on a
warrant granted beforehand by the king is treated as
a constitutional expedient for the redress of particular
grievances as they arise.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c017'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The same inability to devise practical remedies for
specific evils may be traced in several minor clauses of
the Charter.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c017'><sup>[226]</sup></a> When John promised in chapter 16 that no
one should be compelled to do greater service than had been
formerly due from any holding, no attempt was made, in
case of dispute, to provide constitutional machinery to define
what such service actually was; while chapter 45, providing
that only men who knew the law, and meant to
keep it, should be made justiciars, sheriffs or bailiffs,
laid down no criterion of fitness, and contained no suggestion
of any way in which so laudable an ambition might
be realized.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thoughtful and statesmanlike as were the provisions of
Magna Carta, and wide as was the ground they covered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>many important omissions can be pointed out. Some
crucial questions seem not to have been foreseen, and
others, for example the liability to foreign service, were
deliberately shelved<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c017'><sup>[227]</sup></a>—thus leaving room for future misunderstandings.
The praise, justly earned, by its framers
for the care and precision with which they defined a
long list of the more crying abuses, must be qualified in
view of the failure to provide procedure to prevent their
recurrence. Men had not yet learned the force of the
maxim, so closely identified with all later reform movements
in England, that a right is valueless without an
appropriate remedy to enforce it.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c017'><sup>[228]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<h3 class='c015'>VI. Magna Carta: Value of Traditional Interpretations.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The Great Charter has formed a favourite theme for
orators and politicians in all periods of English history,
partly because of its intrinsic merit, partly because of the
dramatic background of its historical setting, but chiefly
because it has been, from the time of its inception down to
the present day, a rallying cry and a protecting bulwark
in every crisis which threatened to endanger the national
liberties.</p>

<p class='c001'>The uses to which it has been put, and the interpretations
which have been read into it, are so numerous and
so varied, that they would require a separate treatise to do
them justice. Not only was Magna Carta, as will be
shown in some detail in a later section, frequently reissued
and confirmed, but its provisions have been asserted
and re-asserted time after time, in Parliament, in the
courts of justice, and in institutional works on jurisprudence.
Its influence has thus been threefold; and any
attempt to explain its bearing on the subsequent history
of English liberties would require to distinguish between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>these three separate and equally important aspects. (1) It
has supplied a powerful instrument in the hands of politicians,
especially of the leaders of the House of Commons
in the seventeenth century, when waging the battle of
constitutional freedom against the Stewart dynasty. (2) Its
legal aspect has been as important as its political one, since
it has been cited in innumerable litigations before the
various courts of law. In the course of legal debate and
of judicial opinions, it has been the subject of many and
conflicting interpretations, some of them accurate and some
erroneous. (3) Finally, it has been discussed in many
commentaries either exclusively devoted to its elucidation
or else treating of it incidentally in the course of general
expositions of the law of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>An exhaustive search throughout the seven centuries
which separate us from 1215 for instances in which Magna
Carta has appeared in the arena of politics, on the judicial
bench, or in legal treatises would prove a gigantic task, but
could hardly fail to illustrate the inestimable services it
has rendered to English liberties.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the light of the important part which Magna Carta
has thus played throughout many centuries of English
history, it need not excite wonder that the estimation in
which it was held, high as that was from a very early
period, has gradually increased, until it has overstepped
all due bounds, and has become utterly exaggerated and
distorted. While some sympathy may be felt for such
extravagant admiration, not unnatural in the circumstances,
it is clearly the duty of the commentator to correct false
impressions. It is well to point out that no document
of human origin can be really worthy of the excessive
eulogy of which the Great Charter has been made the
subject; unfortunately, it has more frequently been described
in terms of inflated rhetoric than of sober methodical
analysis.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c017'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Nor has this tendency to unthinking adulation been
entirely confined to popular writers; judges and institutional
authors, even Sir Edward Coke himself, have too
often lost the faculty of critical and exact scholarship
when confronted with the virtues of the Great Charter.
There is scarcely one great principle of the English constitution
of the present day, or indeed of any constitution
in any day, calculated to secure national liberties, or otherwise
to win the esteem of mankind, which has not been
read by commentators into the provisions of Magna Carta.
In particular, the political leaders of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries discovered among its chapters every
important reform which they desired to introduce into
England, thereby disguising the revolutionary nature of
many of their projects by dressing them in the garb of
the past.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many instances of the constitutional principles and
institutions, with the origin of which successive commentators
have erroneously credited the Great Charter, will be
expounded under the appropriate chapters of the sequel.
It will be sufficient in the meantime to enumerate trial
by jury; the right of every prisoner to obtain a writ of
Habeas Corpus; the abolition of all arbitrary imprisonment
at the king’s command; the complete prohibition
of monopolies; the enunciation of a close and indissoluble
tie between taxation and representation; equality of all
and sundry before the law; a matured conception of
nationality, embracing high and low, freeman and villein
alike: all these, and more, have been discovered in various
clauses of the Great Charter.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c017'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>If these tendencies to excessive and sometimes ignorant
praise have been unfortunate from one point of view, they
have been most fortunate from another. The legal and
political aspects must be sharply contrasted. On the one
hand, the vague and inaccurate words used in speaking
of the Charter even by great lawyers, such as Coke
(not necessarily equally great as historians, living as they
did in an age when the science of history was unknown),
have not only obscured the bearing of many chapters,
but have done a distinct injury to the study of the development
of English law. On the other hand, as the
mistakes made in commenting on the Charter have been
almost entirely due to a laudable desire to extend as
widely as possible its provisions in favour of individual
and national liberties, and to magnify generally its importance;
the service these very errors have done to the
cause of constitutional progress is measureless. If political
bias has coloured the interpretation placed on many of the
most famous clauses, the ensuing benefit has accrued not to
any one narrow party or faction, not to any separate class
or interest, but rather to the entire body politic and to the
cause of national progress in its widest and best developments.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the historian of Magna Carta, while bound to
correct estimates now seen to be erroneous in the light of
modern research, cannot afford to despise or under-estimate
the value of traditional interpretations. The meanings
which have been read into it by the learned men of
later ages, and which have been acquiesced in by public
opinion of the day, have had an equally potent effect
whether they were historically well founded or ill founded.
The stigma of being banned by the Great Charter was
usually too great a burden for any institution or line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>of policy to bear. If the belief prevailed that an abuse
complained of was really prohibited by Magna Carta, the
most arbitrary king had difficulty in finding judges who
would declare it legal, or trustworthy ministers who would
persevere in enforcing it. The prevalence of such a belief
was the main point; whether it was well or ill founded
was, for political purposes, quite immaterial. The greatness
of Magna Carta lies not so much in what it was to
its framers in 1215, as in what it afterwards became to
the political leaders, to the judges and lawyers, and to the
entire mass of the men of England in later ages.</p>

<hr class='c018' />
<div class='footnote' id='f229'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r229'>229</a>. Extravagant estimates of its value will readily occur to anyone
acquainted with the literature of the subject. For example, Sir James
Mackintosh (<cite>History of England</cite>, I. 218, edn. of 1853) declares that we
are “bound to speak with reverential gratitude of the authors of the Great
Charter. To have produced it, to have preserved it, to have matured it,
constitute the immortal claim of England upon the esteem of mankind.
Her Bacons and Shakespeares, her Miltons and Newtons, etc., etc.”
Such uncritical eulogy contributes nothing to the understanding of
Magna Carta.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f230'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r230'>230</a>. Edmund Burke (<cite>Works</cite>, II. 53, edn. of 1837, Boston) credits Magna
Carta with creating the House of Commons! “Magna Charta, if it did
not give us originally the House of Commons, gave us at least a House of
Commons of weight and consequence.” As will be shown in the sequel,
chapter 14 of the Great Charter (the only one bearing on the subject) is in
reality of a reactionary nature, confining the right of attendance at the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commune concilium</i></span> to the freeholders of the Crown and departing from
the precedent of two years earlier, which introduced representatives of
each county.</p>
</div>

<h3 id='TRIALBYJURY' class='c015'>VII. Magna Carta. Its traditional relation to Trial by Jury.</h3>

<p class='c016'>One persistent error, universally adopted for many centuries,
and even now hard to dispel, is that the Great
Charter granted or guaranteed trial by jury.<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c017'><sup>[231]</sup></a> This belief,
however, which has endured so long and played so prominent
a part in political theory, is now held by all competent
authorities to be entirely unfounded. Not one of
the three forms of a modern jury trial had taken definite
shape in 1215, although the root principle from which
all three subsequently grew had been in constant use since
the Norman Conquest. Henry II., indeed, had done much
towards developing existing tendencies in the direction of
all three of its forms, namely, of the grand jury, the petty
criminal jury, and the jury of civil pleas.</p>

<p class='c001'>Magna Carta, embodying as it does many of the innovations
of Henry of Anjou, necessarily contains indications
of the existence of these tendencies. Yet, as these occur
incidentally in various provisions of unconnected chapters,
and as they cannot readily be recognized, on account of the
technical language in which they are usually couched and the
apparently trivial points of legal procedure to which they
relate, it seems well to preface the separate consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>of each of them under its appropriate chapter, by a short
account of their mutual relations. This will conduce
to a clear understanding alike of trial by jury and of the
Great Charter itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Jury trial in each of the three forms in which it is
known to modern English law is able to trace an unbroken
pedigree (though by three distinct lines of descent) from
the same ancestor, namely, from that principle known as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>recognitio</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inquisitio</i></span>, which was introduced into England
by the Normans, and was simply the practice whereby the
Crown obtained information on local affairs from the sworn
testimony of local men. While thus postulating a foreign
origin for this “palladium of English liberties,” we are
afforded consolation by the remembrance of a fact which
some modern authorities are too much inclined to neglect,
namely, that the soil was prepared by Anglo-Saxon labour
for its planting.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c017'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The old English institution of the frithborh—the practice
of binding together little groups of neighbours for
preservation of the peace—and the custom of sending
representatives of the villages to the Hundred Courts, had
alike accustomed the natives to corporate action and formed
in some sort precedents for what their Norman masters
compelled them to do, namely, to give their evidence on
local matters jointly and on oath. Further, one form of
the jury—the jury of accusation—is clearly foreshadowed
(in spite of the complete breach of continuity in the intervening
period) by the directions given to the twelve senior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>thegns of each Wapentake by a well-known law of Ethelred.
Yet the credit of establishing the jury system as a
fundamental institution in England is undoubtedly due to
the Norman and Angevin kings, although they acted in
their own interests and not in those of their oppressed
subjects, and although they had no clear vision of the
ultimate consequences of what they did. The uses to
which the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Inquisitio</cite></span> was put by William and his sons in
framing <cite>Domesday Book</cite>, collecting information about existing
laws, and dispensing justice, have already been discussed.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c017'><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was reserved for Henry II. to start the institution
on a further career of development; he it was who thus
laid the foundations of the modern jury system. Strangely
enough, he did this not merely in one of its forms, but
in all three of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) In re-organizing machinery for the suppression and
punishment of crime by the Assizes of Clarendon and
Northampton, he established the general principle that
criminal trials should (in the normal case) begin with
formal indictment of the accused by a representative body
of neighbours sworn to speak the truth.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c017'><sup>[234]</sup></a> This was merely
a systematic enforcement of one of the many forms of
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inquisitio</i></span> already in use; from that date onwards the
practice so established has been followed in England.
Criminal prosecution cannot be begun on mere suspicion
or irresponsible complaints. The jury of accusation (or
presentment) may be said to have been instituted in 1166,
and has continued in use ever since, passing by an unbroken
course of development into the grand jury of the present
day.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c017'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>(2) By insisting that the ordeal was the only adequate
test of an accused man’s guilt or innocence, Henry unconsciously
prepared the way for a second form of jury.
When the fourth Lateran Council in the very year of Magna
Carta forbade priests to countenance ordeal by their presence
or blessing, a death-blow was really dealt to that form of
procedure or “test,” since it depended for its authority on
superstition. A canon of the Church had thus suddenly
struck away the pivot on which Henry had made his entire
criminal system to revolve. Some substitute required
urgently to be devised. It was to supply this that the
petty jury (or its rude antecedent) came into existence.
The man who had been publicly accused as <em>presumably</em>
guilty by the voice of his neighbours, was asked if he was
willing to stand or fall by a further and final reference
to the oath of a second jury of neighbours. This second
verdict, then, was the new “test” or “law” substituted,
if the accused man agreed, for his old right of proving
himself innocent by the ordeal. By obscure steps, on
which those best entitled to speak with authority are not
yet agreed, this jury, giving a second and final verdict,
gradually developed into the criminal jury of twelve, the
petty jury of to-day, the characteristics of which are well
known and which has had so important an influence on
the development of constitutional liberties in England, and
even, it is said, on the national character.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another expedient of Henry’s invention must have aided
the movement in the direction of the criminal jury, namely,
the writ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de odio et atia</i></span> by applying for which a man
“appealed” or accused of a crime might substitute what
was practically a jury’s verdict for the “battle” which had
previously, in the normal case, followed “appeal” as a
matter of course.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c017'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(3) The Civil Jury owes its origin to quite a different
set of reforms, though inaugurated by the same reformer.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Among the evil legacies left to Henry II. from Stephen’s
reign, not the least troublesome were the numerous claims
advanced by rival magnates to the various estates and
franchises which had been bestowed with equally lavish
hands, but on different persons, by Matilda and Stephen.
Henry realized the urgent need of giving his realm rest
by protecting vested interests and by introducing a more
rational expedient than trial by combat for deciding
between rival claimants to landed estates. Here again
he had recourse to a new development of “inquisition.”
In such cases an option was given to the defendant (the
man in possession, the man with a vested interest which
deserved protection), to refer the question at issue to the
verdict of local recognitors, twelve knights or freeholders
in this case, and therefore men of some position. The
name “Assize” was, for reasons to be immediately explained,
applied alike to the procedure itself and to the twelve
neighbours who gave the verdict.</p>

<p class='c001'>This new expedient, perhaps because it was looked on
with suspicion as an innovation of a violent and revolutionary
nature, was applied at first only to a few special
cases, namely, to certain disputes as to vested interests
in land. It was used to settle claims of ultimate title—the
out-and-out ownership of the land—and then it was
known as the Grand Assize; it was also used to settle
a few well-defined groups of pleas of disputed possession,
and then it was known as a Petty Assize (of which there
were, however, three distinct and well-known varieties).<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c017'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In these cases, the defendant could escape “battle”
and compel the plaintiff, even against his will, to submit
his claim to the verdict of the recognitors. This new-fangled
privilege of the defendant had no basis in the
ancient custom of the land, but depended solely on royal
prerogative. The king, by a high-handed act of power,
thus favoured the defendant, by depriving the claimant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of that remedy which was his right by feudal law, namely,
the resort to the legal duel. It was because the new
procedure was thus founded on a royal Ordinance, that
the name “Assize” was applied to it. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>assisa</i></span> was
a remedy strictly confined to four groups of pleas.</p>

<p class='c001'>By consent of <em>both</em> parties, however, disputes of almost
every description might be similarly determined; being
referred (under supervision of the king’s judges) to the
verdict of local recognitors, usually twelve in number,
who were then known as a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jurata</i></span> (not an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>assisa</i></span>, the two
being strictly opposed to each other). While the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>assisa</i></span>
was narrowly confined to a few types of cases, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jurata</i></span>,
since it favoured neither party, was a flexible remedy capable
of indefinite expansion, and thus soon became the more
popular and the more important of the two. Yet the
ancient <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>assisa</i></span> and the ancient <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jurata</i></span>, always closely
connected, and resembling each other in most essential
features, can both claim to be ancestors of the modern
civil "jury,"—the name of the more popular institution
having survived. Magna Carta, in providing for the frequent
holding of the three Petty Assizes, marked a stage
in the development of the Civil Jury; while, in enforcing
the criminal procedure of Henry Plantagenet, and guarding
it from abuse, the Charter had also a vital bearing on
the genesis of the Grand Jury and the Petty Jury alike.</p>

<p class='c001'>These scattered and incidental references to tendencies
still vague and indefinite must not, however, be misread
as a reference to the definite procedure into which at a
later date they coalesced: Magna Carta does not promise
“trial by jury” to anyone.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>PART IV. <br /> HISTORICAL SEQUEL TO MAGNA CARTA.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'>I. Re-issues and Confirmations of the Great Charter.</h3>

<p class='c016'>While King John had accepted the reforms contained in
Magna Carta unwillingly and insincerely, the advisers of
his son accepted them in good faith. Three re-issues of
the Charter were granted in 1216, in 1217, and in 1225,
and these were followed by many confirmations, a full
account of which would involve a complete political and
legal history of England. The scheme of this Historical
Introduction is restricted to the narration of such facts as
have a direct bearing on the genesis and contents of the
Charter of John. Yet no account of Magna Carta would
be complete without some notice of the more important
alterations contained in these three re-issues.</p>

<p class='c001'>On 28th October, 1216, Henry of Winchester, was
crowned at Gloucester before a small assemblage.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c017'><sup>[238]</sup></a> The
young King took the usual oath as directed by the Bishop
of Bath, and he also performed homage to the Pope’s
representative Gualo, for the King of England was now the
vassal of Rome. At a Council held at Bristol, on 11th
November, William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, was appointed
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Rector regis et regni</i></span>; and, next day, the Charter was
re-issued in the King’s name. This was a step of extreme
importance, marking the acceptance by those in power for
the time being of the programme of the baronial opposition.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>The Charter in its new form was really a manifesto
issued by the moderate men who rallied round the throne
of the young King; it may be viewed in two aspects, as a
declaration by the Regent and his co-adjutors of the policy
on which they accepted office, and as a bid for the support
of the barons who still adhered to the faction of the French
prince. Its issue was, indeed, dictated by the crucial
situation created by the presence in England of Prince
Louis of France supported by a foreign army and by a
large faction of the English barons who had sworn homage
to him as their king. It was, therefore, framed in terms
likely to conciliate such of the opposition as were still open
to conciliation. Yet the new Charter could not be a
verbatim re-issue of the old one. Vital alterations were
required by the altered circumstances.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c017'><sup>[239]</sup></a> It was no longer
the expression of a reluctant consent by the government of
the day to the demands of its enemies, but rather a set of
rules deliberately accepted by that government for its own
guidance. The chief tyrant against whom the original
provisions had been directed was now dead, and certain
forms of tyranny, it was confidently hoped, had died with
him. Restraints now placed on the Crown’s prerogatives
would only hamper the free action of the men who framed
them, not of their political opponents. The new beneficent
government must not suffer for the sins of the old evil
one. The Regent, while willing to do much for the cause
of conciliation, could not afford to paralyze his own
efficiency at a time when foreign invaders were in possession
of one-half of England, from which it would require a
supreme effort to dislodge them. In especial, the Crown,
in its urgent need for money wherewith to pay the wages
of its mercenaries, must suffer no unnecessary restraints
upon its powers of taxation. The existing civil war made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>it imperative that the government should retain a free
hand in exacting feudal services and in levying scutages.
Moderate-minded men would readily acquiesce in the
wisdom of this policy; while it was useless to modify it in
the hope of conciliating the extreme party who had thrown
in their lot irretrievably with Prince Louis.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Charter of 1216 is, therefore, notable for its
omissions. The chief among these may be arranged under
five groups.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c017'><sup>[240]</sup></a> (1) Restraints placed in 1215 on the taxing
power of the Crown now disappeared. The chapters which
forbade the king to increase the “farms” or fixed rents of
the counties and hundreds, those which defined the king’s
relations with the Jews, and those which restricted the
lucrative rights derived from the rigorous enforcement of
the forest laws, were discarded. An even more important
omission was that of the clause which abolished the Crown’s
rights to increase feudal contributions arbitrarily without
consent of the Common Council.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) One clause specially valued by the national Church
was also omitted. John’s grant of liberty of election by
the canons of the chapters was quietly ignored; although
the vague declaration that the Church “should be free”
was allowed to remain.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) A great number of provisions of purely temporary
interest naturally disappeared, among them those providing
for the disbandment of mercenary troops and the dismissal
from office of obnoxious individuals. Of more importance
was the omission of all reference to the device adopted
for enforcing the original Charter by means of the baronial
committee of twenty-five Executors.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) A number of minor omissions of a miscellaneous
nature may be grouped together; for example, chapter 27,
providing that the chattels of every freeman who died
intestate should be divided under the supervision of the
Church; chapter 41, granting freedom to leave the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>kingdom, and return, without the king’s consent; chapter
45, by which the Crown restricted itself in the choice of
justiciars and other officers; and the latter half of chapter
47, relating to the banks of rivers and their guardians.<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c017'><sup>[241]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(5) These various alterations implied, incidentally rather
than deliberately, the omission of all mention of such
constitutional machinery as had found a place in the words
of John’s Great Charter. The twenty-five Executors fell
with the other temporary provisions; while chapter 14,
which defined the composition and mode of summons of the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Commune Concilium</cite></span>, was omitted as a matter of course,
along with chapter 12, to which it had merely formed a
supplement. It was apparently thought unnecessary to make
any mention of the Council, and this attitude may be explained
partly on the ground that the framers of the new
deed took for granted its continued existence in the future
as in the past, and partly by the consideration that its
vital importance as a constitutional safeguard had not yet
been realized. Chapter 14 of 1215, to which much importance
is invariably attached by modern writers, probably
held quite a subordinate place in the minds of its framers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>and was abandoned altogether in 1216, never to be
replaced.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c017'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>However natural may be the explanation, the fact is
no less notable that the only clauses of the original Charter
which partook of a constitutional character entirely disappeared
from all of its re-issues. Magna Carta as granted
by Henry is purely concerned with matters which lie
within the sphere of private law, and contains no attempt
to devise machinery of government or to construct constitutional
safeguards for the protection of national liberties.
The circumstances of the King’s minority, perhaps, implied
a constitutional check on the monarchy in the necessary
existence of guardians, but when Henry III. attained
majority, Magna Carta, deprived of its original sanctions,
would, with the disappearance of the Regency, tend to
become an empty record of royal promises. The entire
machinery of government remained exclusively monarchic;
the king, once out of leading-strings, would be restrained
only by his own sense of honour and by the fear of armed
resistance—by moral forces neither legal nor constitutional.
The logical outcome, under the ripening process of time,
was the Barons’ War.</p>

<p class='c001'>The importance of the omissions is considerably minimized,
however, by two considerations. (<i>a</i>) Many of the
original provisions were merely declaratory, and their
omission in 1216 by no means implied that they were
then abolished. The common law remained what it had
been previously, although it was not considered necessary
to specify those particular parts of it in black and white.
In particular, throughout the entire reign of Henry, the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Commune Concilium</cite></span> frequently met, and was always, in
practice, consulted before a levy was made of any scutage
or aid. (<i>b</i>) It is clearly stated in the new charter that
the advisability of replacing these omitted clauses was
reserved for further consideration at some more opportune
occasion. In the so-called “respiting clause” (chapter 42)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>six topics were specially named as thus reserved because of
their “grave and doubtful” import: the levying of scutages
and aids, the debts of the Jews, the liberty of going from
and returning to England, the forest laws, the “farms” of
counties, and the customs relating to banks of rivers and
their guardians. This respiting clause amounts to a definite
engagement by the King to take into serious consideration
at some future time (probably as soon as peace had been
restored) how far it would be possible to re-insert the
omitted provisions in a new charter. This promise was
partially fulfilled a year later.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c017'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A practical difficulty confronted the advisers of the
young King as to the execution of the Charter. No
instance of a Regency had occurred since seals came into
general use; and, therefore, neither law nor custom afforded
precedents for the execution of documents during a king’s
minority. The seal of a king, like that of any ordinary
magnate, was personal to him, and not available for his
heir. The custom indeed was to destroy the matrix when
a death occurred, and thus to prevent its being put to
improper uses. John’s great seal could no longer be used,<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c017'><sup>[244]</sup></a>
and the advisers of Henry III. shrank from the responsibility
of making a new one for the infant monarch. Yet
no charter would be binding unless executed with all the
recognized formalities. In these circumstances it was
resolved to authenticate the new Charter by impressing
on it the seals of the papal legate and of the Regent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Henry was made to explain that, in the absence of a seal
of his own, the Charter had been sealed with the seals
of Cardinal Gualo and of William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rectoris nostri et regni nostri</i></span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The issue of the new Charter was not immediately
successful in bringing the civil war to an end; but a
stream of waverers flowed from Louis to Henry, influenced
partly by the success of the national faction in the
field and partly by the moderate policy of the government
typified by the re-issue of the Charter. On 19th
May, 1217, the royalists gained a decisive victory at the
battle known as the “Fair of Lincoln”; and, on 24th
August following, Hubert de Burgh, the Justiciar, destroyed
the fleet on which Louis depended. The French prince
was compelled to sue for peace. Although negotiations
were somewhat protracted, the resulting Treaty of Lambeth
bears date the 11th September, 1217, the day on which
they opened.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c017'><sup>[245]</sup></a> Several interviews took place at Lambeth
between 11th and 13th September, and these were followed
by a general conference at Merton, commencing on the
23rd, at which Gualo, Louis, the Regent, and many English
nobles were present.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c017'><sup>[246]</sup></a> Some difference of opinion exists as
to the exact stages of these negotiations,<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c017'><sup>[247]</sup></a> and it seems
best to treat as one whole the settlement ultimately
arranged. “The treaty of Lambeth is, in practical importance,
scarcely inferior to the charter itself.”<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c017'><sup>[248]</sup></a> It marked
the final acceptance by the advisers of the Crown of the
substance of Magna Carta as the permanent basis of
government for England in time of peace, not merely as
a provisional expedient in time of war. Its terms were
equally honourable to both parties: to the Regent and
his supporters, because of the moderation they displayed;
and to Louis who, while renouncing all claim to the
English Crown, did so only on condition of a full pardon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>to his allies, combined with the guarantee of their cause,
so far at least as that was embodied in the Charter.
Ten thousand marks were paid to Louis, nominally as
indemnity for his expenses; but he had in return to
restore the Exchequer Rolls, the charters of the Jews
(that is the rolls on which copies of their starrs or
mortgages had been registered),<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c017'><sup>[249]</sup></a> the Charters of Liberties
granted by John at Runnymede, and all other national
archives in his possession. Sir William Blackstone thinks
it probable that, under this clause of the treaty, the
original of the Articles of the Barons was handed over, and
deposited among the other archives of the Archbishop of
Canterbury at Lambeth Palace where it remained until
the middle of the seventeenth century.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c017'><sup>[250]</sup></a> One condition
of this general pacification was of supreme importance—the
promise given by the Regent and the papal legate
to grant a new and revised Charter. This promise was
fulfilled some six weeks later, a Charter of Liberties and
a separate Forest Charter being issued on the 6th November,
1217.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c017'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The issue of these two Charters put the copestone to
the general pacification of the kingdom. After the wide-spread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>havoc wrought by two years of civil war, the
moment had come for a definite and final declaration by
the Regent of his policy for ruling an England once more
at peace. Not only was he bound in honour to this
course by the Treaty of Lambeth, but the opportunity
was a good one for fulfilling the promise made in chapter
42 of the Charter of 1216. Accordingly the respiting
clause of that document now disappeared altogether, and
some new clauses took its place. The matters reserved for
further discussion as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gravia et dubitabilia</i></span>” had now been
reconsidered and were either finally abandoned, or else
accepted with more or less radical alterations. The results
of these deliberations are to be found in a number of
additions to the Charter of Liberties of 1217, the most
important of which are chapters 44 and 46, and in the
terms of a Forest Charter now granted for the first time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Chapter 46 is a “saving clause,” reserving to archbishops,
bishops, abbots, priors, templars, hospitallers, earls, barons,
and all other persons, cleric and lay, the liberties and free
customs which they previously had. The vagueness of this
provision (a mere reference to the undefined and misty
past) deprived it of all practical value. The other addition
was of much greater importance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Chapter 44 directed that scutages should be taken in
the future as they had been wont to be taken in the time
of Henry II. Now, the rates of scutage and the procedure
for levying it in that reign had been quite specific, and
could still be read among the Rolls of the Exchequer
recently recovered from Prince Louis. It was thus easy
to define the various innovations of John’s reign, those
well-hated additional burdens which had furnished the
chief motive for the civil war, and which Henry III. was
now made to promise should be utterly swept away.
This general condemnation probably included the increased
frequency of John’s exactions, the assessment of scutages
on the new basis provided by the Inquest of 1212, the
levy of both scutage and service cumulatively, and, above
all, the exaction of the high rate of three marks per knight’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>fee. The essence of the demands pressed on the government
by the baronial leaders in 1217 must undoubtedly
have been the return to the normal maximum rate of 20s.
per knight’s fee. Henry II., we have seen, sometimes
took less, but only on one occasion took more.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c017'><sup>[252]</sup></a> This
provision, it should be needless to say, did not preclude
the barons individually or collectively from volunteering
to contribute at a higher rate; and the necessity of such
abnormal contributions would naturally be determined at
meetings of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Commune Concilium</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The substitution of this definite stipulation of a return
to the well-known usage of Henry II. in place of the
discarded chapters 12 and 14 of John’s Charter (which
made “common consent” necessary for <em>all</em> scutages, whatever
the rate) was a natural compromise; and the barons
in agreeing to it were probably quite justified in thinking,
from their own medieval point of view, that they were
neither submitting to any unfair abridgments of their
rights, nor yet countenancing any reactionary measures
hurtful to the growth of constitutional liberty.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c017'><sup>[253]</sup></a> Yet
when this alteration is viewed by modern eyes in the light
cast by the intervening centuries of constitutional progress,
and when it is remembered that the new clause formed the
chief part of the concessions made in 1217 to baronial
claims, the conclusion inevitably suggests itself that the
new agreement is the proof of retrograde tendencies
successfully at work. All mention of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Commune
Concilium</i></span>—that predecessor of the modern Parliament,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>that germ of all that has made England famous in the
realm of constitutional laws and liberties—disappears,
apparently without protest or regret. If the control of
taxation by a national assembly, if the conception of representation,
if the indissoluble connection of these two
principles with each other, ever really found a place in
Magna Carta, they were contemptuously ejected from it
in 1216, and failed to find a champion in 1217 to
demand their restoration.</p>

<p class='c001'>A modern statesman, with any knowledge of the value
of constitutional principles, would have gladly seized the
occasion of the revision of the terms of the Charter, to
assert and define the functions and rights of the Great
Council with precision and with emphasis. He would not
lightly have thrown away the acknowledgment implied in
chapters 12 and 14 of 1215—in the germ, at least—of
the right of a national council to exercise a legal control
over the levying of taxes. The magnates on both sides
in 1217 were content, however, to abandon to their fate
all abstract principles of constitutional development, provided
they could protect their lands and purses from an
immediate increase of taxation. Far-reaching problems
of the composition and privileges of Parliament were
unhesitatingly surrendered, as soon as another method of
defence against arbitrary increase of scutage was suggested.
The barons were selling, not indeed their birthright, but
their best means of gaining new rights from the Crown,
for “a mess of pottage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such considerations, however, must not be pressed too
far. It should not be forgotten that no one seriously
thought in 1217, any more than in 1216, of dispensing
with future meetings of the feudal tenants in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Commune
Concilium</i></span>. Great Councils indeed continued to meet with
increasing frequency throughout the reign of Henry III.,
and the consent of the magnates therein assembled was
habitually asked to scutages even at a lower rate than
that which had been normal in Henry II.’s reign. Sometimes
such consent was given unconditionally; sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>in return for a new confirmation of the cherished Charters;
sometimes, even, it was met by an absolute refusal—the
first distinct instance of which seems to have occurred in
January, 1242.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c017'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another set of provisions which the respiting clause of
1216 had promised to reconsider was amply restored in
the terms of a separate Forest Charter. This took the place
not only of certain chapters of the original grant of 1215
omitted in 1216, but also of chapters 36 and 38 of the
grant of 1216. Nothing was, however, done to restore
other important omissions, namely, those relating to the
Jews, to intestate succession, to free ingress to and egress
from England. On the other hand, additional provisions,
not promised in the respiting clause, were directed against
various abuses of the Crown’s feudal and other prerogatives.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c017'><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>So far the Charter of 1217, with its restorations and
additions, may be regarded as a politic effort to secure the
support of the barons by satisfying their reasonable
demands; but it may also be viewed in three other aspects:
(1) as containing provisions for suppressing the anarchy
still prevalent in several districts, a legacy from the civil
war; (2) as amending some few details of the original
grant which the experience of two years had shown to be
defective or objectionable; and (3) as making a first
attempt to solve certain problems of government which had
come quite recently to the foreground, but which were not
successfully grappled with until three-quarters of a century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>later, when the legislative genius of Edward Plantagenet
was brought to bear upon them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the chapters restoring order, the most important,
with the exception of those recasting the machinery of
administration, was that which ordered the destruction of
the “adulterine” castles,<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c017'><sup>[256]</sup></a> that is, the private strongholds
built by barons without the licence of the Crown. These
remained in 1217, as they had remained in 1154, a
result of past civil war, and a menace to peace and good
government in the future. It was the aim of every
efficient ruler to abolish all fortified castles—practically
impregnable in the thirteenth century when artillery
was unknown—except those of the King, and to see that
the royal castles were under command of “constables”<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c017'><sup>[257]</sup></a> of
approved loyalty. John had placed his own strongholds
under creatures of his own, who, after his death, refused
to give them up to his son’s Regent. The attempt to
dislodge these soldiers of fortune, two years later, led to
new disturbances in which the famous Falkes de Breauté
played a leading part.<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c017'><sup>[258]</sup></a> The destruction of “adulterine”
castles and the resumption of royal ones were both
necessary accompaniments of any real pacification.</p>

<p class='c001'>The re-issue of 1217 may also be regarded as bearing
some analogy to a modern amending Statute. Experience,
for example, had suggested the desirability of several
alterations in the procedure for holding petty assizes.
Many objections had been taken to the dispatch of Justices,
with commissions to hold assizes in the various counties,
so frequently as four times every year. It was now agreed
to reduce these circuits from once a quarter to once a year—a
concession to those who felt the burden of too frequent
attendance.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c017'><sup>[259]</sup></a> Although the king’s Justices were still to
enjoy the co-operation of knights from each county, it was
no longer specially mentioned that these knights should be
<em>elected</em>. All pleas of darrein presentment were removed
from the jurisdiction of the Justices on circuit, and reserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>for the consideration of “the Bench,” presumably now
settled at Westminster.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c017'><sup>[260]</sup></a> The two other assizes (novel
disseisin and mort d’ancestor) were still left to the king’s
Justices in the respective counties where the lands lay, but
difficult points of law were reserved for “the Bench.”<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c017'><sup>[261]</sup></a>
The inferiority of the Justices of Assize to the Courts at
Westminster was thus made clear.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same natural reluctance of those who owed suit
to the local courts, to neglect their own affairs in
order to perform public duties, which led to the demand
for less frequent visits of the Justices of Assize, led also to
an emphatic restatement of the old customary rules as to
attendance at County Courts. Ordinary sessions were not
to be held more frequently than once a month, nor was the
sheriff to make his Tourn, or local circuit, throughout the
various hundreds of his county more frequently than twice
a year, namely at Easter and Michaelmas: and only at
Michaelmas was he to hold view of frankpledge—one of the
most important functions performed by him in the course of
his circuit.<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c017'><sup>[262]</sup></a> It was a more distinct concession to the
feudal anti-centralizing spirit, that this royal view of frankpledge—for
the sheriff acted as the king’s deputy—was
prohibited from infringing any freeman’s franchises, whether
such franchises had existed under Henry II. or had been
subsequently acquired.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c017'><sup>[263]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Two questions, destined to become of supreme importance
in the future, have also left traces on this re-issue of the
Charter:—on chapters 39 and 43 respectively. The
former treats of the vexed question of a feudal tenant’s
right to dispose of parts of his holding by gift or sale.
There were two different methods of effecting this—by way
of subinfeudation or by way of substitution: the tenant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>might create a new link in the feudal chain by granting
part of his lands to a third party, who became his vassal as
a result of the new grant; or he might endeavour to make
the donee the direct vassal of his overlord, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quoad</i></span> the land
he had newly acquired. There was here a direct conflict of
interest between overlord and tenant, which extended to
both ways of conveying land. Freedom to sell it or give
it away was clearly an advantage to the tenant; while the
lord objected to a transaction which might thrust on him
new vassals he did not desire, or might divide between two
or more vassals the obligations formerly incumbent on one,
making the incidence of feudal burdens uncertain and their
enforcement more difficult. Chapter 39 contained a compromise.
The tenant might part with a portion of his
holding, provided the balance he reserved was sufficient to
ensure full performance by himself of the obligations due
to the lord. The original vassal thus remained primarily
liable for the whole of the feudal obligations (whatever
right of relief he might have against his donees or sub-tenants),
and must reserve in his own hands sufficient lands
out of the proceeds of which to fulfil them. The final
solution of the problem, here temporarily disposed of, was
contained in the Statute commonly known as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Quia Emptores</i></span>,<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c017'><sup>[264]</sup></a>
which allowed the tenant to dispose of parts of his estate
by way of substitution, while forbidding subinfeudation
entirely.</p>

<p class='c001'>Chapter 43 marks the growing hostility against the
accumulation by the monasteries of wealth in the form of
landed estates, and begins the series of legislative measures
which culminated in the Statute of Mortmain.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c017'><sup>[265]</sup></a> The times
were not ripe in 1217 for a final solution of this problem,
and the charter of that year contented itself with an
attempt to remedy one of the subsidiary abuses of the
system merely, and not to abolish the main evil. An
ingenious expedient had been devised by lawyers to
enable tenants to cheat their lords out of some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>lawful feudal incidents. Religious houses formed one
species of corporation, and all corporations made bad
tenants, since, as they never died, the lord of the fief was
deprived of the possibility of a wardship, relief, or escheat
falling to him. This was a hardship; but it was not unfair,
provided that the transaction which made the abbey or
monastery owner of the subjects was a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bona fide</i></span> one. Sometimes,
however, more or less collusive agreements were
made between a lay free-holder and a religious house
whereby a new link was inserted in the feudal chain to
the prejudice of the freeholder’s lord. The freeholder
bestowed his lands on a particular house, which took his
place as the new tenant of the lord and then subinfeudated
the same subjects to the original tenant, who thus got his
lands back again, but now became tenant of the church,
not of his former lord. The lord was thus left with a
corporation for his tenant and lost all the profitable incidents,
which would, under the new arrangement, accrue to
the church when the freeholder died. Such expedients were
prohibited, under pain of forfeiture, by chapter 43 of the
re-issue of 1217; and this prohibition was interpreted
very liberally by the lords in their own favour.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c017'><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These were the main alterations made in 1217 in the
tenor of the Great Charter.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c017'><sup>[267]</sup></a> This re-issue is of great
importance, since it represents practically the final form
taken by the Charter, only two changes being made in
subsequent issues.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c017'><sup>[268]</sup></a> On the 22nd February, 1218, copies
of the Great Charter in this new form were sent to the
sheriffs to be published and enforced. In the writs accompanying
them, the special attention directed to the clause
against unlicensed castles shows the importance attached
to their demolition.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c017'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>The Regent and the ministers of the Crown seem to
have felt increasingly the inconvenience of conducting the
government without a great seal of the King. There was
a natural reluctance to accept grants authenticated merely
by substitutes for it, since these might not be treated as
binding on the monarch when he came of age. The Regent
at last agreed to the engraving of a great seal for Henry,
but not without misgivings. To prevent it being used by
unscrupulous ministers to validate lavish grants to their
own favourites to the impoverishment of the Crown, the
Council, on the advice of the Regent, issued a proclamation
that no charter or other deed implying perpetuity should
be granted under the new seal during the King’s minority—a
saving clause of which Henry was destined to make a
startling use. This proclamation was probably issued soon
after Michaelmas 1218.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c017'><sup>[270]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On 14th May, 1219, England lost a trusted ruler
through the death of the aged Regent, whose loyalty, firmness,
and moderation had contributed so much to repair the
breaches made in the body politic by John’s evil deeds, and
the consequent civil war. After the good Earl of Pembroke’s
death, the Bishop of Winchester and Hubert de
Burgh contended for the chief place in Henry’s councils,
with alternating success, but neither of them succeeded to
the title of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Rector regis et regni</i></span>.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c017'><sup>[271]</sup></a> A few years later, the
young King seems to have grown impatient under the
restraints of a minority, and the Roman Curia was ready
to bid for his goodwill by humouring him. In 1223
Honorius III., by letter dated 13th April, declared Henry
(then only in his sixteenth year) to be of full age as
regarded most of the duties of a king.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c017'><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The terms of this papal letter may have suggested to
some of Henry’s councillors the possibility of renouncing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>the Charters on the ground that they had been granted to
the prejudice of the King before he had been declared of
full age. One of his flatterers, William Briwere by name, at
a “colloquium” held in January, 1223, advised him to
repudiate the two Charters when requested by Stephen
Langton to confirm them. Briwere’s bold words are
reported by Matthew Paris.<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c017'><sup>[273]</sup></a> “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Libertates quas petitis,
quia violenter extortae fuerunt, non debent de jure observari.</i></span>”
This doctrine of repudiation moved the primate
to anger, and Henry, still accustomed to leading-strings,
gave way, swearing to observe the terms of both charters.
An element of truth, however, underlay Briwere’s advice,
and the whole incident probably showed to the more far-seeing
friends of liberty the necessity of a new and
<em>voluntary</em> confirmation of the Charters by the King. An
opportunity for securing this occurred next year, when
Henry at Christmas, 1224, demanded one-fifteenth of all
his subjects’ moveables. He was met by a firm request
that he should, in return for so large a grant, renew
Magna Carta. The result was the re-issue on 11th
February, 1225, of both Charters each of which was, as a
matter of course, fortified by the impression of the great seal
recently made. The importance of the whole transaction
was enhanced by the declaration made by Honorius III.
only two years previously, that Henry was of full age to
act for himself. The new forest Charter was practically
identical with that issued in 1217; while the only alterations
in the tenor of the Charter of Liberties were the
result of a laudable determination to place on record the
circumstances in which it had been granted. In the new
preamble Henry stated that he conceded it “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>spontanea
et bona voluntate nostra</i></span>” and all reference to the consent
of his magnates was omitted, although a great number
of names appear as witnesses at the close of the Charter.
These alterations were intended to emphasize the fact
that no pressure had been brought to bear on him, and
thus to meet future objections such as William Briwere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>had suggested in 1223, namely, that the confirmation of
the Charter had been extorted by force.<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c017'><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The “consideration” also clearly appears in the concluding
portion of the Charter, where it is stated that in return for
the foregoing gift of liberties along with those granted in the
Forest Charter, the archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, earls,
barons, knights, free tenants, and all others of the realm
had given a fifteenth part of their moveables to the King.</p>

<p class='c001'>The prominence given to this feature brings the transaction
embodied in the re-issue of 1225 (as compared with
the original grant of 1215) one step nearer the legal
category of “private bargain.” It is, in one aspect, simply
a contract of purchase and sale. Another important new
clause follows—founded probably on a precedent taken
from chapter 61 of the Charter of King John: Henry
is made significantly to declare “And we have granted
to them for us and our heirs, that neither we nor our
heirs shall procure any thing whereby the liberties in this
charter shall be infringed or broken; and if any thing
shall be procured by any person contrary to these
premises, it shall be held of no validity or effect.” This
provision was clearly directed against future papal dispensations
or abrogations, such as that which King John had
obtained from Innocent in 1215. The clause, however,
was diplomatically made quite general in its terms.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c017'><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One original copy of this third re-issue of the Great
Charter is preserved at Durham with the great seal in
green wax still perfect, though the parchment has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“defaced and obliterated by the unfortunate accident of
overturning a bottle of ink.”<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c017'><sup>[276]</sup></a> A second is to be found
at Lacock Abbey, in Wiltshire. The accompanying Forest
Charter is also preserved at Durham.<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c017'><sup>[277]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This third re-issue brings the story of the genesis of
the Great Charter to an end. It marked the final form
assumed by Magna Carta; the identical words were then
used which afterwards became stereotyped and were confirmed,
time after time, without further modification. It
is this Charter of 1225 which is always referred to in
the ordinary editions of the Statutes, in the courts of law,
in parliament, and in a long series of classical law books
beginning with the second <cite>Institute</cite> of Sir Edward Coke.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c017'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although the Charter, thus, in 1225 took the permanent
place it has since retained among the fundamental laws of
England, it was not yet secure from attacks. Two years
later the actions of Henry raised strong suspicions that he
would gladly annul it, if he dared.</p>

<p class='c001'>The young King, in spite of the Pope’s bull declaring
him of full age in 1223, had in reality only passed from
one set of guardians to another; he had long chafed under
the domination of the able but unscrupulous Peter des
Roches, Bishop of Winchester, when in the beginning of
1227 he suddenly rebelled. Acting probably under the
advice of Hubert de Burgh, who wished to return to power,
Henry determined to shake off the control of Bishop Peter.
At a Council held at Oxford in January, 1227, Henry,
though not yet twenty, declared himself of full age;<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c017'><sup>[279]</sup></a> and
soon thereafter showed what use he intended to make of
his newly acquired freedom. Making an unexpected
application of the proclamation issued by the Regent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>William Marshal, in 1218, that the great seal should not,
during the minority, be used to authenticate any grants in
perpetuity of royal demesne lands or other rights of the
Crown, Henry now interpreted this to imply the nullity of
all charters whatsoever which had been issued under the
great seal since his accession. He even tentatively applied
this startling doctrine to the Forest Charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Henry’s new policy seems to have been endorsed by the
magnates present, and on 21st January, 1227, he issued
by their “common counsel” a series of “letters close”
directing that all recipients of Crown charters must apply
for their renewal—a ceremony requiring, of course, to be
handsomely paid for. On 9th February a second series
of “letters close” was issued, resulting in the extension
of many forests to their old boundaries once more.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c017'><sup>[280]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Fears, apparently unfounded, that the Great Charter
was in danger, seem to have been rife. If Henry really
entertained any intention of setting aside Magna Carta, it
is fortunate that the attack upon it, suggested to the King
by William Briwere in January, 1223, was not seriously
attempted until four years later. The delay was of supreme
importance, since there had intervened the third re-issue of
the Charter containing the declaration that the King had
acted voluntarily, and fortified by the facts that Honorius
had previously declared him of full age for such purposes,
and that he had accepted a price for the confirmation of
the Charter. Henry could not now repudiate the papal
dispensation which he had gladly accepted and acted upon
four years earlier. In this way the re-issue of both charters
in 1225 had gone far to secure the national liberties.
Henry shrank from any open infringement of the Great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Charter; and, although he was partially successful in
restoring the forests to their old wider boundaries, thus
undoing many reforms of his minority, he proceeded without
violating the letter of the Forest Charter. Henceforward,
Henry’s attitude towards the charters was a settled one,
and easily understood. He confirmed them with a light
heart whenever he could obtain money in return, and
thereafter acted as though they did not exist.</p>

<p class='c001'>Henceforth history is concerned not with re-issues but
with confirmations of the Great Charter. Of these the
number is considerable, beginning with that granted at
Westminster on 28th January, 1237;<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c017'><sup>[281]</sup></a> but it forms no part
of the scheme of this Historical Introduction to describe
these in detail.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c017'><sup>[282]</sup></a> One of them, the so-called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Confirmatio
Cartarum</cite></span> of 5th November, 1297, is specially important,
not because it is a confirmation, but because it is something
more. It contains new clauses which impose
restrictions on the taxing power of the Crown; and these,
to some extent, take the places of those chapters (12 and
14) of the original grant of John, which had been omitted
in all intervening re-issues and confirmations.</p>

<p class='c001'>A Statute of 1369 (42 Edward III. c. 1), requires special
notice, since it commands that “the Great Charter and
the Charter of the Forest be holden and kept in all points,
and if any statute be made to the contrary that shall be
holden for none.” Parliament in 1369 thus sought to
deprive future Parliaments of the power to effect any
alterations upon the terms of Magna Carta. Yet, if Parliament
in that year had the power to add anything by a
new legislative enactment to the ancient binding force of
the Great Charter, it follows that succeeding Parliaments,
in possession of equal powers, might readily undo by a
second statute what the earlier statute had sought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>effect. If Parliament had power to alter the sacred terms
of Magna Carta itself, it had equal power to alter the less
sacred statute of 1369 which declared it unalterable. The
terms of that statute, however, are interesting as perhaps
the earliest example on record of the illogical theory
(frequently reiterated in later years) that the English
Parliament might use its present legislative supremacy in
such a manner as to limit the legislative supremacy of
other Parliaments in the future.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f240'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r240'>240</a>. This classification takes no account of such alterations as seem to be
merely verbal or inserted to remove ambiguities, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>e.g.</i></span> upon chapters 22,
28, and 30 of the original Charter.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f241'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r241'>241</a>. These alterations show traces of some influence at work hostile to the
national Church. Not only is the promise of canonical election withdrawn,
but the omissions of the clauses regulating intestate succession
and guaranteeing freedom to leave the kingdom (a privilege highly
valued by the clergy) seem to prejudice the interests of English churchmen.
Now the papal legate was an active supporter of the re-issue of this
Charter in 1216; whereas Rome, in the crisis of June, 1215, had been
bitterly opposed to the original grant of Magna Carta. The inference is
that Rome did not protest against these omissions to the prejudice of the
English Church. Why was this? The explanation probably lies in the
divergence of the interests of the national Church from those of the Church
universal. Canonical election, for example, was nothing to Rome;
successive Popes made provision for their favourites more readily in
England by bringing pressure to bear on the King than on the monks of
the various chapters. Henry III. habitually acted on the omission;
creating wide-felt discontent by filling the English sees partly with his
own foreign favourites, and partly with ecclesiastics nominated by the
Roman Curia. The King and the Pope thus entered into a tacit
partnership for their mutual benefit at the expense of the English
national Church.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f242'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r242'>242</a>. It is notable that it failed to find a place in the Charter of 1225, which
was paid for by the nation at the price of one-fifteenth of moveables.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f243'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r243'>243</a>. Dr. Stubbs propounds the theory that this re-issue of 1216 represents a
compromise whereby the central government, in return for increased taxing
powers, allowed to the feudal magnates increased rights of jurisdiction. He
gives, however, no reasons for this belief, either in <cite>Select Charters</cite>, p. 339,
or in his <cite>Constitutional History</cite>, II. 27. It is abundantly clear that the
Crown reserved a free hand for itself in taxation, but there seems no
evidence to support the other part of the theory, namely, that feudal
justice gained new ground against royal justice in 1216 which had not been
already gained in 1215.</p>

enactment, and opened a claim on the king’s part to legislate by sovereign
authority without counsel or consent." (<cite>Const. Hist.</cite>, II. 37.) This

<h3 class='c015'>II. Magna Carta and the Reforms of Edward I.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The Great Charter, alike from its excellences and from
its defects, exercised a potent influence on the trend of
events throughout the two succeeding reigns. It is hardly
too much to say that the failure of Magna Carta to
provide adequate machinery for its own enforcement is
responsible for the spirit of unrest and for the protracted
struggles and civil war which made up the
troubled reign of Henry III.; while the difference of
attitude assumed by Henry and by his son Edward respectively
towards the scheme of reform it embodied explains the
fundamental difference between the two reigns—why the
former was so full of conflicts and distress, while the latter
was so prosperous and progressive. To trace the history
of these reigns in detail lies outside the scope of this
Historical Introduction. It seems necessary, however, to
emphasize such outstanding events as have an obvious and
close connection with the Great Charter, and also to outline
the policy of Edward, which led ultimately to the
triumph of its underlying principles.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fundamental difference between the reigns of
Henry III. and Edward I. lies in this, that while
Henry, in spite of numerous nominal confirmations of
Magna Carta, never loyally accepted the settlement it
contained, Edward, on the contrary, acquiesced in the
main provisions of the Great Charter, under many subtle
modifications it is true, yet honestly on the whole, and
with a sincere intention to carry them into practice.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>At the same time, the attitude even of Henry III.
towards Magna Carta indicates a distinct advance upon
that of his father. It was much that the advisers of
John’s infant heir solemnly accepted, on behalf of the
Crown, the provisions of the Charter, and strove to enforce
them during the minority; and it was even more that
Henry, on attaining majority, confirmed the arrangement thus
arrived at, freely and on his own initiative, and found himself
thereafter unable openly to repudiate the bargain he had
made. Yet the settlement of the dissensions between Crown
and baronage was still nominal rather than real. In the
absence of proper constitutional machinery, the king was
merely bound by bonds of parchment which he could
break at pleasure. The victory of the friends of liberty
proved a hollow one, since unsupported promises count for
little in the great struggles fought for national liberties.
Even the crude constitutional devices of the Charter of
1215 entirely disappeared from its confirmations; and, in
the absence of all sanctions for its enforcement, the Charter
became an empty expression of good intentions. If a
quarrel arose, no constitutional expedient existed to reconcile
the disputants—nothing to obviate a final recourse
to the arbitrament of civil war. Thus, part of the blame
for the recurring and devastating struggles of the reign
of Henry III. must be attributed to the defects of the
Great Charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole interest of the reign indeed lies in the
various attempts made to evolve adequate machinery for
enforcing the liberties contained in Magna Carta. Experiments
of many kinds were tried in the hope of turning
theory into practice. The system of government outlined
in the Provisions of Oxford of 1258, for example, reproduced
the defects of the crude scheme contained in
chapter 61 of the Great Charter, and added new defects of
its own. It sought to keep the king in the paths of
good government by the coercion of a body of his enemies.
This baronial committee was not designed to enter into
friendly co-operation with Henry in the normal work of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>government, but rather to supersede entirely his right
to exercise certain of the royal prerogatives. No glimmering
was yet apparent of the true solution afterwards
adopted with success. It was not yet realized that the
best way to control the Crown was through the agency
of its own ministers, and not by means of a hostile
opposition organized for rebellion—that the correct policy
was to make it difficult for the king to rule except
through regular ministers, and to secure that all such
ministers should be men in whom the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Commune Concilium</cite></span>
reposed confidence and over whom it exercised control.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is true that Simon de Montfort may have had
some vague conception of the real constitutional remedy
for the evils of the reign; but his ideals were overruled
in 1258 by the more extreme section of the
baronial party. Earl Simon indeed had one opportunity
of putting his theories into practice. During the brief
interval between the battle of Lewes, which made him
supreme for the moment, and the battle of Evesham, which
ended his career, he enjoyed an unfettered control over the
movement of reform; and some authorities find in the
provisional scheme of government, by means of which he
attempted to realize his political ideals in the closing
months of 1264, traces of the true constitutional expedient
afterward successfully adopted as a solution of the problem.
In one respect, undoubtedly, the Earl of Leicester did
influence the development of the English constitution;
he furnished the first precedent for a national Parliament,
which reflected interests wider than those of the Crown
tenants and the free-holders, when he invited representatives
of the boroughs to take their places by the side of the
representatives of the counties in the national council
summoned to meet in January, 1265. His schemes of
government, however, were not fated to be realized by
him in a permanent form. The utter overthrow of his
faction followed his decisive defeat and death at Evesham
on 4th August, 1265.</p>

<p class='c001'>The personal humiliation of Simon de Montfort, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>in reality assured the ultimate triumph of the cause he had
made his own. Prince Edward, from the moment of his
brilliant victory at Evesham, was not only supreme over
his father’s enemies, but henceforth he was supreme also
within his father’s councils. He found himself in a position
at once to realize some of his most important political ideals;
and from the very moment of his victory, he adopted as his
own, with some modification, it is true, the main constitutional
conceptions of his uncle Earl Simon, who had been
his friend and teacher before he became his deadliest
enemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Edward Plantagenet, alike when acting as the chief
adviser of his aged father and after he had succeeded him
on the throne, not only accepted the main provisions of the
Great Charter,<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c017'><sup>[283]</sup></a> but adopted also, along with them, a new
scheme of government which formed their necessary
counterpart. To Edward is due the first dim conception of
“parliamentary government,” to this extent at least, that
the king, as head of the executive government, should take
a national council into partnership with him in the work
of national administration. His political ideals were the
natural result of the experience obtained during the later
years of his father’s reign; and he endeavoured to embody
in his scheme of government the best parts of the various
experiments in which that reign abounded. His policy,
although founded on that of his uncle Simon de Montfort,
was profoundly modified by his own individual genius.
The very fact of the adoption of Earl Simon’s ideals by
the heir to the throne entirely altered their chances of
success. All such schemes had been foredoomed to failure so
long as they merely emanated from an opposition leader
however powerful; but their triumph was speedily assured
now that they were accepted as a programme of reform by
the monarch himself. Henceforth the new political ideals,
summed up in the conception of a national Parliament,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>were to be fostered by the Crown’s active support, not
merely thrust upon the monarchy from without.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under the protection of Edward I.—the last of the four
great master-builders of the constitution—the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Commune Concilium</cite></span>
of the Angevin kings (itself a more developed form
of the Curia Regis of the Conqueror and his sons) grew into
the English Parliament. This implied no sudden dramatic
change, but a long slow process of adjustment, under the
guiding hand of Edward.</p>

<p class='c001'>The main features of his scheme may be briefly summarized:
Edward’s conception of his position as a national
king achieving national ends, the funds necessary for
effecting which ought to be contributed by the nation,
naturally led him to devise a system of taxation which
would fill the Exchequer while avoiding unnecessary
friction with the tax-payer. His problem was to keep his
treasury full in the way most convenient to the Crown,
and at the same time to reduce to a minimum the discontent
and inconvenience felt by the nation at large
under the burden. In broadening the basis of taxation,
he was led to broaden the basis of Parliament; and thus
he advanced from the feudal conception of a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Commune
Concilium</i></span>, attended only by Crown tenants, to the nobler
ideal of a national Parliament containing representatives
of every community and every class in England. The
composition of the great council was altered; the principle
of representation known for centuries before the Conquest
in English local government, now found a home, and, as
it proved, a permanent home, in the English Parliament.
It was obvious that Parliament, whose composition was
thus altered, must meet more frequently than of old.
Edward elevated the national council from its ancient
position of a mere occasional assembly reserved for special
emergencies, to a normal and honoured place in the scheme
of government. Henceforth, frequent sessions of parliament
became a matter of course.</p>

<p class='c001'>The powers of this assembly also widened almost automatically,
with the widening of its composition. Taxation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>was its original function, since that was the primary
purpose (so the best authorities maintain in spite of
some adverse criticism) for which the representatives of
the counties and the boroughs had been called to it.
Legislation, or the right to veto legislation, was soon
added—although at first the new-comers had only a
humble share in this. The functions of hearing grievances
and of proffering advice had, even in the days of
the Conqueror, belonged to such of the great magnates
as were able to make their voices heard in the Curia
Regis; and similar rights were gradually extended to
the humbler members of the augmented assembly. The
representatives of counties and of towns retained rights
of free discussion even after Parliament had split into two
separate Houses. These rights, fortified by command of
the purse strings, tended to increase, until they secured
for the Commons some measure of control over the
executive functions of the king. This parliamentary control
varied in extent and effectiveness with the weakness of
the king, with his need of money, and with the political
situation of the hour.</p>

<p class='c001'>The new position and powers of Parliament logically
involved a corresponding alteration in the position and
powers of the smaller but more permanent council or
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Concilium Ordinarium</i></span> (the future Privy Council). This
had long been increasing in power, in prestige, and in
independence, a process quickened by the minority
of Henry III. The Council was now strengthened by
the support of a powerful Parliament, usually acting in
alliance with the leaders of the baronial opposition. The
members of the Council were generally recruited from
Parliament, and their appointment as king’s ministers
and members of the Curia was strongly influenced by the
proceedings in the larger assembly.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Council thus became neutral ground on which the
conflicting interests of king and baronage might be discussed
and compromised. Wild schemes like that of
chapter 61 of Magna Carta or like that typified in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Committee appointed by the Mad Parliament in 1258, were
now unnecessary. The king’s own ministers, backed by
Parliament, became an adequate means of enforcing the
constitutional restraints embodied in royal Charters.
The problem was thus, for the time being, solved. A
proper sanction had been devised, fit to change royal promises
into realities.</p>

<p class='c001'>To sum up, Edward’s aim of ruling as a national king
implied the frequent assembling of a central parliament
composed of individuals fitted to act as links between the
Crown and the various classes of the English nation whom
he expected to contribute to the national Exchequer. It
implied also that the national business should be conducted
by ministers likely to command the confidence of
that parliament.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c017'><sup>[284]</sup></a> Thus, Edward’s policy dimly foreshadowed
some of the most fundamental principles of
modern constitutional government—parliament, representation,
ministerial responsibility. Edward Plantagenet was,
of course, far from realizing the full meaning of these
conceptions, and if he had realized it, he would have been
most unwilling to accept them; yet he was unconsciously
helping forward the cause of constitutional progress.</p>

<p class='c001'>This temporary solution, during the reign of Edward I.,
of an ever-recurring problem of government has been
viewed in two different aspects. It is sometimes regarded
simply as the result of the pressure of events—as a natural
phenomenon evolved, subject to natural laws, to meet
the needs of the age. By other writers it is attributed to
the wisdom and conscious action of King Edward. The
two views are perhaps not so inconsistent as they at first
sight seem, since great men work in harmony with the
spirit of their times, and appear to control events which
they only interpret and express. The bargain made at
Runnymede between the English monarch and the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>nation found its necessary counterpart and sanction, before
the close of the thirteenth century, in the conception of a
king ruling through responsible ministers and in harmony
with a national Parliament. Edward Plantagenet
was merely the instrument by whose agency the new
conception was for a time partially realized. Yet, he
merits the gratitude of posterity for his share in the elaboration
of a working scheme of government, which took the
place of the clumsy expedients designed as constitutional
sanctions by the barons in 1215. He supplied the logical
complement of the theories vainly enunciated in John’s
Great Charter, thus changing empty expressions of good
intentions into accomplished facts. The ultimate triumph
of the principles underlying Magna Carta was assured
through the constitutional machinery devised by Edward
Plantagenet.</p>

<p class='c008'>MAGNA CARTA: ORIGINAL VERSIONS, PRINTED EDITIONS, AND COMMENTARIES.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>I. Manuscripts of Magna Carta and Relative Documents.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The barons who had forced the Great Charter on King
John were determined that its contents should be widely
known and permanently preserved. It was not sufficient
that the great seal should be formally impressed upon one
parchment. Those who compelled John to submit were
not content even with the execution of its terms in duplicate
or in triplicate, but insisted that the great seal should
be appended to many copies all of practically identical
terms and of equal authority. These were to be distributed
throughout the land, and to be preserved in
important strongholds and among the archives of the
chapters of cathedral churches.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <em>The extant original versions.</em> Of the many copies
of the Charter authenticated under John’s great seal, four
have escaped the destroying hand of time, and may still be
examined by members of the public after nearly seven
centuries have passed. These four records are:</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <em>The British Museum Magna Carta, number one</em>—formally
cited as “Cotton, Charters XIII. 31<span class='fss'>A</span>.” The recent
history of this document is well known. It was found
among the archives of Dover Castle in the seventeenth
century; and not improbably it may have lain there
for centuries before, possibly from a date not much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>later than that of its original execution; for the castle of
Dover, like the Tower of London, was a natural place for
the preservation of documents of national value. There
it was discovered by Sir Edward Dering while warden of
the castle, and by him it was presented to Sir Robert
Cotton, accompanied by a letter dated 10th May, 1630.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c017'><sup>[285]</sup></a>
It still forms an item in the collection preserved in the
British Museum, which bears the name of the famous
antiquary.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the great fire of 23rd October, 1731, which attacked
the Cottonian Library, this valuable Charter was seriously
damaged and rendered in parts illegible, while the yellow
wax of the seal was partially melted. It is possible that
this accident has added somewhat to the prestige of this
particular copy of Magna Carta, which, like the three others
still extant, is written continuously, though with many
contractions, in a neat, running, Norman hand. A special
characteristic of this version is that some omissions seem to
have been made in the body of the deed and to have been
supplied at the foot of the parchment. These are five in
number.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c017'><sup>[286]</sup></a> It is possible to regard them as corrections of
clerical omissions due to carelessness or hurry in engrossing
the deed; but the fact that one of the additions is distinctly
in the King’s favour raises a strong presumption
that they embodied additions made as afterthoughts to
what had been originally dictated to the engrossing clerk,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>and that they were inserted at the King’s suggestion
before he would adhibit the great seal.</p>

<p class='c001'>The importance of this document was recognized at a
comparatively early date, and a facsimile prepared by John
Pine, a well-known engraver of the day, some eighteen
months after the great fire. The engraving bears a certificate
dated 9th May, 1733, narrating that the copy
is founded on the original, which had been shrivelled up
by the heat; but that where two holes had been burned,
the obliterated words had been replaced from the other
version (to be immediately described), also preserved in
the Cottonian collection.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <em>The British Museum Magna Carta, number two</em>—formally
cited as “Cotton, Augustus, II. 106.” The early
history of this document is unknown, but sometime in
the seventeenth century it came into the possession of
Mr. Humphrey Wyems, and by him it was presented to Sir
Robert Cotton on 1st January, 1628–9. Unlike the other
Cottonian copy, this one is happily in an excellent state of
preservation; but there is no trace left of any seal.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c017'><sup>[287]</sup></a>
Three of the five addenda inserted at the foot of the
copy previously described are found in a similar position
here; but the substance of the two others is included in
the body of the deed. On the left-hand margin, titles
intended to be descriptive of several chapters occur in a
later hand.<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c017'><sup>[288]</sup></a> Thus for the preservation of two original
copies of the national charter of liberties the nation is
indebted to Sir Robert Cotton, but for whose antiquarian
zeal they might both have been lost. Apparently, however,
a story told by several authors<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c017'><sup>[289]</sup></a> as to the humiliating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>fate which threatened the original Magna Carta must be
rejected. Sir Robert, it is said, discovered “the palladium
of English liberties” in the hands of his tailor at the
critical moment when the scissors were about to transform
it into shapes for a suit of clothes. This is undoubtedly
a fable, since both manuscripts of Magna Carta in the
Cottonian collection are otherwise accounted for.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <em>The Lincoln Magna Carta.</em> This copy is under the
custody of the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral, where
it has undoubtedly lain for many centuries. It has been
suggested that Bishop Hugh of Lincoln, canonized by the
Roman Church, whose name appears in the list of magnates
consenting to John’s grant, may have brought it with him
from Runnymede on his return to Lincoln. The word
“Lincolnia” is endorsed in a later hand in two places at
the back of the document on folds of the parchment. It
has no corrections or additions inserted at the foot, but
embodies in their proper places all those which occurred in
the versions already discussed. Further, it is executed with
more flourishes and in a more finished manner than these,
and the inference is that it took longer to engross. The
Record Commissioners in preparing the <cite>Statutes of the Realm</cite>
considered this version as of superior authority to any of
the others and have accordingly chosen it as the copy for
their engraving of Magna Carta published in 1810 in that
valuable work, and also in the first volume of their edition
of Rymer’s <cite>Foedera</cite> in 1816.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c017'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <em>The Salisbury Magna Carta</em>—preserved in the archives
of the Cathedral there. The early history of this manuscript
has not been traced, but its existence was known
at the close of the seventeenth century.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c017'><sup>[291]</sup></a> Sir William
Blackstone, in April, 1759,<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c017'><sup>[292]</sup></a> instituted a search for it, but
without success—his inquiries being met with the statement
that it had been lost some thirty years before, during
the execution of repairs in the Cathedral library. As its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>disappearance had really taken place during the tenure of
the see by Gilbert Burnet, whose antiquarian interests
were well known, his political adversaries accused him of
appropriating it—an undoubted calumny, yet one to which
some colour was lent by facts to be hereafter explained.
The document had not been re-discovered in 1800 when
the royal commission published its report of the result of
its inquiries for national records.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c017'><sup>[293]</sup></a> Two sub-commissioners
visited Salisbury in 1806 in search of it, but obtained no
satisfaction. It seems, however, to have been re-discovered
within the next few years, since it is mentioned in a
book published in 1814,<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c017'><sup>[294]</sup></a> and it is now exhibited to the
public by order of the Dean and Chapter of Salisbury
Cathedral. It resembles the Lincoln copy both in its
beautiful leisurely writing and also in the absence of
additions at the bottom of the parchment.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c017'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>II. <em>Comparison of the Originals.</em> Prior to the publication
of Sir William Blackstone’s great work, extraordinary confusion
seems to have prevailed concerning the various
Charters of Liberties. Not only was John’s Magna Carta
confused with the various re-issues by Henry; but these
latter were known only from an official copy of the Charter
of 1225 contained in the confirming statute of the twenty-eighth
year of the reign of Edward I., known as an
“Inspeximus,” because of the opening word of the King’s
declaration that he had seen the document of which he gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>a copy. Neither Madox<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c017'><sup>[296]</sup></a> nor Brady<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c017'><sup>[297]</sup></a> was aware of the
existence of any one of the four originals; and no mention
is made of them in the first edition of Rymer’s <cite>Foedera</cite>,
which appeared in 1704. Mr. Tyrrell indeed seems to have
known of the second original copy in the British Museum
and also of the Salisbury version.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c017'><sup>[298]</sup></a> Mr. Care<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c017'><sup>[299]</sup></a> showed no
clear knowledge of the various manuscripts, though he
mentioned the existence of several. Even Sir William
Blackstone in 1759 collated only the two Cottonian copies,
since he failed to find that of Salisbury, and was unaware
of the existence of the Lincoln manuscript.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c017'><sup>[300]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As these four versions are practically identical in their
substance—the variations being merely in the use of
contractions or in other verbal changes of a trivial character—no
important question seems to be involved in the
discussion as to whether any one of them has greater value
than the others. The Record Commissioners considered that
the Lincoln copy was the first to be completed (and therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>that it possessed special authority), because, unlike the
two Cottonian copies, it contained no insertions at the foot
of the instrument. Yet it seems more plausible to argue
that this very immunity from clerical errors, or from
additions made after engrossment, proves that it was of
later and less hurried execution than the others, and
therefore of less authority, if any distinction is permissible.
Mr. Thomson has much ground for his contention in
speaking of the fire-marked version in the British Museum
that “the same circumstances may probably be a proof of
its superior antiquity, as having been the first which was
actually drawn into form and sealed on Runnymede, the
original whence all the most perfect copies were taken.”<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c017'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In all printed texts of Magna Carta, the contents are
divided into a preamble and sixty-three chapters, and each
chapter is numbered and treated in a separate paragraph
by itself. There is no warrant for this in any one of the
four originals, all of which run straight on from beginning
to end, like other feudal charters, and contain no numbers
or other indication where one provision ends and another
begins. Strictly speaking, Magna Carta has thus no
chapters: these are a modern invention, made for convenience
of reference.</p>

<p class='c001'>III. <em>The Articles of the Barons.</em> Of hardly inferior
historical interest to these four original copies of the Great
Charter is the parchment which contains the heads of the
agreement made between John and the rebels on 15th
June, 1215, from which the Charter was afterwards expanded.
The parchment containing these heads, known as
the Articles of the Barons, is now in the British Museum,
cited officially as “Donation MSS. 4838.” The seven
centuries which have passed over it have left surprisingly
few traces; it is quite legible throughout, and still bears
the impression of John’s great seal in brown wax. It is
probable that this document may have passed with other
English records into the hands of Prince Louis during the
civil war which followed close on the transaction at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Runnymede; that it was handed over to the Regent
William Marshal in terms of the Treaty of Lambeth concluded
in September, 1217; and that thereafter it was
deposited in Lambeth Palace, where it remained until the
middle of the seventeenth century. Archbishop Laud
seems to have been aware of its historical interest, as
he placed it among the more precious documents in his
keeping. When threatened with impeachment by the
Long Parliament, he thought it prudent to set his papers in
order; and on 18th December, 1640, he dispatched for
that purpose to his episcopal palace, his friend Dr. John
Warner, Bishop of Rochester.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was indeed no time to lose; a few hours
later, Laud was committed to the custody of Black-Rod,
and an official messenger was sent by the House of Lords
to seal up his papers. Bishop Warner had, however,
escaped with the Articles of the Barons before this
messenger arrived; he kept it till he died, and at his death
it passed to one of his executors named Lee, and from him
to his son Colonel Lee, who presented it to Gilbert Burnet,
afterwards Bishop of Salisbury and author of the famous
<cite>History of His Own Time</cite>. When the Salisbury Magna
Carta disappeared, Burnet was suspected of appropriating
it to his own uses. The grounds which gave some apparent
weight to the misrepresentations of his political opponents
were that special facilities had been granted to him to
search public records in the prosecution of his historical
labours, and that as matter of fact he actually had in his
possession—quite lawfully, as we now know—the Articles
of the Barons, which was confused by the carelessness of
early historians with Magna Carta itself. The calumny was
so widely spread that Burnet thought it necessary formally
to refute it, explaining that he had received the Articles as
a gift from Colonel Lee. “So it is now in my hands, and
it came very fairly to me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bishop Burnet left it as a legacy to his son Sir Thomas
Burnet; and on his death it passed to his executor David
Mitchell, whose permission to print it Blackstone obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>in 1759. Shortly thereafter it was purchased from Mr.
Mitchell’s daughter by another great historian, Philip, second
Earl of Stanhope, and by him it was presented to the
British Museum in 1769. It is now exhibited to the
public along with the two Cottonian copies of Magna Carta.
The Record Commissioners have reproduced it in facsimile
in <cite>Statutes of the Realm</cite> in 1810, and also in the <cite>New
Rymer</cite> in 1816.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c017'><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The document begins with this headline: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ista sunt
Capitula quae Barones petunt et dominus Rex concedit.</i></span>” Then
the articles follow in 49 paragraphs of varying length,
separate, but unnumbered, each new chapter (unlike the
chapters of Magna Carta, which run straight on as befits
its character as a charter) beginning a new line. The
numbers which invariably appear in all printed editions
have no warrant in the original.</p>

<p class='c001'>A blank space sufficient for two lines of writing occurs
between paragraphs 48 and 49, indicating perhaps that
the last chapter, which contains the revolutionary provision
for the appointment of the twenty-five Executors,
had been added as an after-thought. Chapters 45 and 46
are connected by a rude bracket, and a clause is added in
the same hand as the rest, but more rapidly, modifying the
provisions of both in the King’s favour. This, at least, is
clearly an after-thought.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c017'><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a id='UNKNOWNCHARTEROFLIBERTIES'></a>IV. <i>The so-called “unknown Charter of Liberties.”</i> Among
the French archives there is preserved the copy of what
purports to be a charter granted by King John, but
irregular in its form. This document is preserved among
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Archives du Royaume</cite></span> in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Section Historique</cite></span> and
numbered J. 655.<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c017'><sup>[304]</sup></a> A copy of this copy was discovered
at the Record Office in London by Mr. J. Horace Round in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>1893, previous to which date it seems to have been
practically unknown to English historians, although it had
been printed by a French writer thirty years earlier.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c017'><sup>[305]</sup></a> Mr.
Round communicated his discovery of this “unknown
charter of liberties” to the <cite>English Historical Review</cite>, in
the pages of which there ensued a discussion as to its
nature and validity, inaugurated by him. Three theories
were suggested: (<i>a</i>) Mr. Round maintained that the document
was a copy, in a mangled form perhaps, of a charter
actually granted in the year 1213 by King John to the
northern barons, containing concessions which they had
agreed to accept in satisfaction of their claims.<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c017'><sup>[306]</sup></a> (<i>b</i>) Mr.
Prothero preferred to view it, not as an actually executed
charter, given and accepted in settlement of the various
claims in dispute, but rather as an abortive proposal made
by the King early in 1215 and rejected by the barons.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c017'><sup>[307]</sup></a>
(<i>c</i>) Mr. Hubert Hall dismissed the document as a forgery,
and described it as "a coronation charter attributed
to John by a French scribe in the second decade of
the thirteenth century"—probably between November,
1216, and March, 1217, when King Philip desired to
prove that John had committed perjury by breaking his
promises, and had thereby forfeited his right to the Crown
of England.<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c017'><sup>[308]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Hall describes the method of procedure adopted
by the compiler of this supposed forgery. Placing in front
of him copies of Henry I.’s Charter of Liberties and of
Henry III.’s charters issued in 1216-17, he proceeded to
select from these sources whatever suited his purpose, and
thereafter “either by design or carelessness, or ignorance of
English forms, he altered the wording of both his originals
so as to produce the effect of a paraphrase interspersed
with archaisms.” This extremely ingenious theory is not
entirely convincing. Not to insist on the number of
unproved inferences on which it is based, it seems to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>one grave defect—it ignores the absurdity of attempting
to obtain credence for such a clumsy composition, especially
when it was well known that John had never granted a
coronation charter at all. Even if a skilful forger could
have utilized the document as the basis for a completed
charter, this would still have required the impress of John’s
great seal to give it validity. Such an imposture could
not be seriously intended to impose on any one.</p>

<p class='c001'>A fourth theory may be suggested very tentatively,
namely, that the document in question is a copy of the
actual schedule drawn up by the barons previous to 27th
April, 1215. That such a schedule existed we know from
the express declaration of Roger of Wendover,<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c017'><sup>[309]</sup></a> who informs
us that it was sent to the King with the demand that his
seal should be forthwith placed to it, under threat of civil
war. From this, it is safe to infer that the schedule, as
it left the barons’ hands, was ready for execution; but
lack of experience in drawing up Crown charters would
prevent them from producing an entirely regular instrument.
They would assuredly take as their model the
charter of Henry I., which had helped to give definiteness
of aim to all their efforts. It would be necessary,
however, to bring this up to date, by additions which we
might <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> expect to resemble the provisions afterwards
adopted with more elaboration in the agreement
made at Runnymede. This schedule, then, rapidly thrown
together, would be likely to contain many of the characteristics
actually discovered by Mr. Hall in the document
under discussion. Such an identification of the “unknown
Charter of Liberties” with the schedule of 27th
April, 1215, would explain all the features emphasized
by Mr. Hall—the archaisms, the erroneous style, and
the employment, first of the third person singular, and
then of the first person singular, instead of using throughout
the first person plural invariably used by John. It
would also explain why the first half of the parchment
on which the “unknown charter” is written, contains a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>copy of Henry I.’s charter, and why the two possess so
many features in common.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would clearly be inadvisable to found any conclusions
upon the terms of a document, the nature and authenticity
of which form the subject of so many rival theories; but
even if further investigation proves it to be a forgery,
a forgery of contemporary date may throw light on otherwise
obscure passages in genuine charters. One or two
instances of this will be found in the sequel.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>II. Previous Editions and Commentaries.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Every general history of England and almost every book
which has ever appeared on English law has had something
to say by way of commentary on Magna Carta. It is
perhaps for this very reason that exceedingly few treatises
have been devoted exclusively to its elucidation. While
edition after edition of the text of the Charter, or of its
re-issues, have appeared, few of these have been accompanied
by explanations however brief. The paucity of attempts
to explain the meaning of the Charter is almost more
remarkable than the frequency with which the text has
been reproduced. Magna Carta is a document often
printed, but seldom explained.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <em>Printed Editions of the Text of Magna Carta.</em> Previous
to 1759 even the best informed writers on English history
laboured under much confusion in regard to the various
charters of liberties. Few of them seem to have been
aware that fundamental differences existed between the
original charter granted by John and the re-issues of Henry
III. Much of the blame for this confusion must be borne
by Roger of Wendover, who, in his account of the transactions
at Runnymede, incorporated, in place of John’s
Charter, the text of the two charters granted by Henry.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c017'><sup>[310]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The early historians were content to rely either on this
version or on that contained in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Inspeximus</cite></span> of Edward I.
Thus, in all early printed collections of statutes, the text
which professes to represent the original Charter follows in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>reality the words of Henry’s third re-issue. The very
earliest printed edition of Magna Carta seems to have been
that published on 9th October, 1499, by Richard Pynson,
the King’s printer,<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c017'><sup>[311]</sup></a> and a contemporary of Wynkyn de
Worde. This was not, of course, John’s Charter, but
followed Edward’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Inspeximus</cite></span> of Henry’s Charter of
1225.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since the middle of the eighteenth century, many
editions of the text of John’s Great Charter have been
published, either alone or along with the text of the
various re-issues of the reign of Henry III.; but it
seems unnecessary to mention more than four of these.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) In 1759 appeared Sir William Blackstone’s scholarly
work entitled <cite>The Great Charter and The Charter of the
Forest</cite>, containing accurate texts of all the important issues
of the Charters of Liberties carefully prepared from the
original manuscripts so far as these were known to him.<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c017'><sup>[312]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) In some respects the Record Commissioners have
improved even on Blackstone’s work in their edition of
the <cite>Statutes of the Realm</cite>, published in 1810. A special
section of the volume is devoted to Charters of Liberties,
where not only the grants of John and Henry III., but
also the charters which led up to them, and their subsequent
confirmations, have received exhaustive treatment.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) A carefully revised text, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Magna Carta regis Johannis</cite></span>,
was published by Dr. Stubbs in 1868; and the various
charters are also to be found, arranged in chronological
order, in his well-known volume, first published in
1870, entitled <cite>Select Charters and other illustrations of</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span><cite>English Constitutional History</cite>, a convenient collection easily
accessible to all students of law and history.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) For the continuous study of the sequence of charters,
the best book of reference is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Chartes de Libertés Anglaises</cite></span>
by M. Charles Bémont published in 1892, in the pages of
which the various editions of John’s and Henry’s charters
will be found in a form convenient for comparison with
each other, and with previous and succeeding documents.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <em>Commentaries and Treatises.</em> It is doubtful whether
any good purpose would be served by the preparation of
a list of all the books which contain casual references to
Magna Carta or to its provisions; and it is clear that the
task would be an extremely burdensome one. There is
no difficulty, however, in naming the few treatises of outstanding
merit which have been exclusively or mainly
devoted to the exposition of the Great Charter. Of
these only nine require special mention.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) The mysterious medieval lawbook known as the
<cite>Mirror of Justices</cite> contains a chapter upon Magna Carta
which has some claims to rank as a commentary, although
it represents the opinions of a political pamphleteer rather
than those of an unbiassed judge. The date of this treatise
is still the subject of dispute. It has been usual to place it
not earlier than the years 1307-27, mainly because it
makes mention of “Edward II.” Prof. Maitland, however,
dates it earlier, maintaining on general grounds that it was
“written very soon after 1285, and probably before
1290.”<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c017'><sup>[313]</sup></a> He explains the reference to “Edward II.” as
applying to the monarch now generally known in England
as Edward I., but sometimes in his own reign known as
Edward II., to distinguish him from an earlier Edward,
still enshrined in the popular imagination, namely, Edward
Confessor. Mr. Maitland is not disposed to treat this work
of an unknown author too seriously, and warns students
against “his ignorance, political bias, and deliberate lies.”<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c017'><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>(2) Dismissing the <cite>Mirror</cite>, then, as a dangerous and
possibly disingenuous guide, the earliest serious commentary
known to exist is that of Sir Edward Coke,
formerly Lord Chief Justice. This elaborate treatise,
forming the second of Coke’s four <cite>Institutes</cite>, was published
in 1642 under direction of the Long Parliament, the
House of Commons having given the order on 12th May,
1641.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c017'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although this commentary, like everything written by
Coke, was long accepted as a work of great value, its
method is in reality entirely uncritical and unhistorical.
The great lawyer reads into Magna Carta the entire body
of the common law of the seventeenth century of which
he was admittedly a master. He seems almost unconscious
of the great changes accomplished by the experience
and vicissitudes of the four eventful centuries which
had elapsed since the Charter had been originally granted.
The various clauses of Magna Carta are thus merely
occasions for expounding the law as it stood, not at the
beginning of the thirteenth century, but in his own day.
In the skilful hands of Sir Edward, the Great Charter
is made to attack the abuses of James or Charles, rather
than those of John or Henry, which its framers had in
view. In expounding the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium parium</i></span>, for example,
he carefully explains many minute details of procedure
before the Court of the Lord High Steward, and describes
elaborately the nature of the warrants to be issued prior
to the arrest of any one by the Crown; while, in the
clause of Henry’s Charter which secures an open door to
foreign merchants in England “unless publicly prohibited,”
he discovers a declaration that Parliament shall have
the sole power to issue such prohibitions, forgetful that
the regulation of trade was an exclusive prerogative of
the Crown with which Parliament had no right to interfere
for many centuries subsequent to the reign of
Henry III.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) In 1680 Mr. Edward Cooke, barrister, published
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>a small volume entitled <cite>Magna Charta made in the ninth
year of King Henry III. and confirmed by King Edward I.
in the twenty-eighth year of his reign</cite>. This contained a
translation of Henry’s Magna Carta with short explanatory
notes founded mainly on the commentary of Sir Edward
Coke. In his Preface, Mr. Cooke declared that his object
was to make the Great Charter more accessible to the
public at large, since, as he said, “I am confident, scarce
one of a hundred of the common people, know what
it is.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) Sir William Blackstone’s <cite>Introduction</cite> to his edition
of the charters, published in 1759, as already mentioned,
contains valuable information as to the documents he edits;
but he explicitly disclaims all intention of writing a
Commentary. He is careful to state “that it is not in
his present intention, nor (he fears) within the reach of
his abilities, to give a full and explanatory comment on
the matters contained in these charters.”<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c017'><sup>[316]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(5) The Hon. Daines Barrington published in 1766 his
<cite>Observations upon the Statutes from Magna Charta to 21
James I.</cite> This book contains some notes on the Charter
also founded chiefly upon Coke’s <cite>Second Institute</cite>; his
original contributions are not of outstanding value.</p>

<p class='c001'>(6) In 1772 Prof. Francis Stoughton Sullivan gave to
the public his course of lectures previously delivered in
the University of Dublin under the title <cite>An Historical
Treatise on the Feudal Law, with a Commentary on Magna
Charta</cite>. The author’s own words give a sufficiently
accurate conception of its scope and value: “I shall
therefore proceed briefly to speak to <cite>Magna Charta</cite>, and
in so doing shall omit almost all that relates to the
feudal tenures, which makes the greatest part of it, and
confine myself to that which is now law.”<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c017'><sup>[317]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(7) Mr. John Reeves’ invaluable <cite>History of English Law</cite>,
the first edition of which appeared in 1783-84, marked the
commencement of a new epoch in the scientific study
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>of the genesis of English law. Treating incidentally of
Magna Carta, he shows wonderful insight into the real
purport of many of its provisions, but the state of historical
knowledge when he wrote rendered many serious errors
inevitable.</p>

<p class='c001'>(8) In 1829, Mr. Richard Thomson published an
elaborate edition of the charters combined with a commentary
which contains much useful information, but
makes no serious attempt to supplement the unhistorical
explanations of Sir Edward Coke by the results of more
recent investigations in the provinces of law and history.
His work is a storehouse of information which must,
however, be used with caution.</p>

<p class='c001'>(9) In many respects, the most valuable contribution
yet made to the elucidation of the Great Charter is that
contained in M. Charles Bémont’s preface to his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Chartes des
Libertés Anglaises</cite></span>, published in 1892. Although he has
subjected himself to the severe restraints imposed by the
slender size of his volume and by a rigid desire to state
only facts of an undisputed nature, leaving theories strictly
alone; he has, nevertheless, done much to help forward
the study of the charters. In particular he has performed
an important service by insisting upon the close mutual
connection between the various Charters of Liberties, from
that of Henry I. down to the confirmations of Edward I.,
and of subsequent kings. It is doubtful, however, whether
by this very insistence upon the gradual process of development
which may be traced in this long series, he does not
lay himself open to the misconception that he takes too
narrow a view of the scope and relations of the
Charter. Magna Carta’s points of contact with the past
and future history of English liberties and English laws
and institutions must not be narrowed down to those
occurring in one straight line. Its antecedents must not
be looked for exclusively among documents couched in the
form of charters, nor its results merely in their subsequent
confirmations. It is impossible to understand it aright,
except in close relation to all the varied aspects of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>national life and the national development. Every Act
appearing on the Statute Rolls is, in a sense, an Act
amending Magna Carta; while such enactments as the
Statute of Marlborough and the Statute of Westminster I.
have as intimate a connection with John’s Great Charter
as the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Confirmatio Cartarum</cite></span> or the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Articuli super Cartas</cite></span>
have. This is a truth which M. Bémont undoubtedly
recognizes, though the scheme of his book led him rather
to emphasize another and, at first sight, contradictory
aspect of his subject. His object was not to explain the
numerous ways in which the Charters of Liberties are
entwined with the whole of English history, but merely
to furnish a basis for the accurate study of one of their
most important features. His book is indispensable, but
is not intended to form, in any sense, a commentary
on Magna Carta.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would thus appear that only two serious attempts
have been made to produce treatises forming, explicitly
and exclusively, commentaries on the Great Charter, namely
the <cite>Second Institute</cite> of Coke and the laborious and useful
work of Mr. Richard Thomson. Since Mr. Thomson’s
<cite>Magna Charta</cite> appeared, three-quarters of a century have
passed, marking an enormous advance in historical and
legal science; yet the results of modern research, so capable
of throwing light on the subject-matter of the Great
Charter, have never been systematically brought to bear
upon it. Dr. Stubbs, from whom such a work would have
been especially welcome, contented himself with giving a
paraphrase or abstract of the Charter, rendering into English
equivalents as literally as possible the actual words of his
Latin text—a cautious course, which cannot lead his
disciples astray, but leaves them to the guidance of
their own ignorance rather than of his knowledge.
The reason given by Dr. Stubbs for keeping silence is
rather the excess than the absence of information. “The
whole of the constitutional history of England,” he tells us,
“is little more than a commentary on Magna Carta.”<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c017'><sup>[318]</sup></a> It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>is for this reason, presumably, that he refrains from
all explanations and confines himself to an abstract
of its main provisions. While thus many invaluable
hints may be obtained from the pages of the three
volumes of his history, and from his other works, Dr.
Stubbs has not in any of his published writings contributed
anything of the nature of a direct commentary
upon John’s Great Charter. In this policy, he has been
followed by the members of the great modern school of
English historians of which he is the founder.<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c017'><sup>[319]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Many valuable hints may be obtained from other writers
such as Dr. Gneist, Sir Edward Creasy, Mr. Taswell
Langmead, Dr. Hannis Taylor, Miss Norgate, and Sir James
Ramsay,<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c017'><sup>[320]</sup></a> but their efforts to explain the meaning of the
Great Charter take the form of disconnected notes, rather
than of exhaustive commentaries.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c017'><sup>[321]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Great Charter of John opens, in the form common
to all royal charters of the period, with a greeting from
the sovereign to his magnates, his officials, and his
faithful subjects, and announces, in the pious legal formula
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>used by impious and pious kings alike, that he had
made certain grants by the advice of those counsellors
whom he names. Three features of this preamble call for
comment.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>The King’s Title.</i> Some points of interest are suggested
by the form of the royal style adopted by John,
which is connected by an unbroken thread of development
with that of William I. on the one hand, and of His
Majesty, Edward VII., on the other. John’s assumption
of the royal plural “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Sciatis Nos</i></span>” reads, in the light of
subsequent history, as a tribute to his arrogance rather
than to his greatness, when compared with the humbler
first person singular consistently used by his more distinguished
father. In this particular, however, Richard,
not John, had been the innovator on the usage of Henry
II.<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c017'><sup>[325]</sup></a> For a further alteration in the royal style John
was alone responsible. To the titles borne by his father
and brother, John invariably added that of “lord of
Ireland,” a reminiscence of his youth. When the wide
territories of Henry II., had been distributed among his
elder sons, the young John (hence known as “John
Lackland”) was left without a heritage, until his father
bestowed on him the island of Ireland, recently appropriated;
and this brought with it the right to style himself
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominus Hibernie</i></span>.” This title of his younger days was
not unnaturally retained by him after he had outlived
all his brothers and inherited their wide lands and
honours.</p>

<p class='c001'>John began his reign in 1199 as ruler over the
undivided possessions of the House of Anjou at their
widest stretch, extending without a break, other than the
waters of the Channel, from the Cheviots to the Pyrenees.
These lands were held by John, as by his father, under a
variety of titles and conditions. Anjou, the original home
and fief of the hot-blooded Plantagenet race, still carried
with it only the modest rank of count. In addition to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>this paternal title, Henry II. had, at an early age, become
duke of Normandy in his mother’s right, and thereafter
duke of Aquitaine by marriage with Eleanor, its heiress.
These three great fiefs were held by Henry and his sons
under the king of France as their lord paramount. Long
before 1215, John’s bad fortune or incompetence had lost
to him these wide continental dominions except the most
distant of them all, his mother’s dowry of Aquitaine.
His ancestral domains of Anjou and Normandy
had been irretrievably lost, but he still retained their
empty titles; and in this his son Henry III. followed him,
grasping the shadow long after the substance had fled.
Entries relating to Gascony frequently appear on the
Rolls of Parliament of Edward I.; and the kings of
England were styled dukes of Aquitaine, dukes of Guienne,
or dukes of Gascony (the three descriptions being used
indifferently) until Edward III. merged all these titles
in a wider one, when he claimed the throne of
France.</p>

<p class='c001'>England alone, of John’s possessions, real and nominal,
was held by the higher style of “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Rex</i></span>,” implying strictly
sovereign rule, independent of any overlord, and retained
by John in 1215 in spite of his recent acceptance of
Innocent III. as feudal overlord. Of Ireland, John was
still content to describe himself, as formerly, “lord,” not
king. The exact meaning of the word “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Dominus</i></span>” in
medieval charters, particularly in those of Stephen, has
been made the subject of much learned controversy;
which has not yet resulted in a consensus of opinion
as to the technical meaning, if any, borne by the word.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c017'><sup>[326]</sup></a>
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Dominus</i></span>,” indeed, seems to have been loosely used
wherever something of substance or of ceremonial was
lacking from the full sovereignty implied in the more
specific name of king. In this connection much stress
was laid on the solemn sacrament of coronation, implying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>among other things formal consecration by the
church.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c017'><sup>[327]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John’s connection with England, then, is expressed in
two simple words, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Rex Anglie</i></span>,” no explanation being
vouchsafed of how he had acquired this title. Such vindication,
indeed, was not called for, as this was no coronation
charter, John having already reigned for fifteen years without
any serious rival—the claims of Arthur, the son of
his elder brother Geoffrey, never having been taken
seriously in England.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c017'><sup>[328]</sup></a> The simple words, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Dei gratia
rex Anglie</i></span>,” may be contrasted with the detailed titles
set out in the coronation charters of Henry I. and
Stephen respectively. Henry I. in 1100 had emphasized
his relationship to preceding kings, describing himself as
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Filius Willelmi regis post obitum fratris sui Willelmi,
Dei gracia rex Anglorum</i></span>”;<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c017'><sup>[329]</sup></a> while Stephen in April,
1136, in his second and more deliberate charter, used
an entirely different formula, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Dei gracia assensu cleri et
populi in regem Anglie electus, et a Willelmo Cantuarensi
archiepiscopo et sancte Romane ecclesie legato consecratus, et
ab Innocentio sancte Romane sedis pontifice postmodum confirmatus</i></span>,”<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c017'><sup>[330]</sup></a>
the laboured nature of which betrays the consciousness
of weakness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus Henry I. and Stephen each laid stress on the
strong points of his title and ignored its defects. These
two claims of kingship express, in a crude form, two
rival theories of the title to the English Crown—(1)
hereditary succession, and (2) election. Neither of
these is an accurate reflection of the full theory and
practice of the twelfth century, which blended both principles
in proportions not easy to define with accuracy.
Professor Freeman has pushed to excess the supposed
right of the Witenagemot to elect the king, and has
transferred wholesale to the Norman <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia</i></span> (which, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>some respects, took its place) all the powers enjoyed by
its forerunner. A recent German writer, Dr. Oskar
Rössler,<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c017'><sup>[331]</sup></a> has gone equally far in the opposite direction,
flatly denying that the Normans ever admitted the elective
element at all. The theory now usually held is a mean
between these extremes, namely that the Norman <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia</i></span>
(or the chief magnates who usually composed it) had a
limited right of selecting among the sons, brothers, or
near relations of the last king, the individual best suited
to succeed him. Such a right, never authoritatively enunciated,
gradually sank to an empty formality. Its place
was taken, to some extent, by the successful assertion
by the spiritual power (usually represented by the archbishop
of Canterbury), of a claim to give or withhold
the consecrating oil which accompanied the church’s blessing.
Without this no <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominus</i></span> could be recognized as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rex</i></span>. On this theory the descriptions of their own titles
given by Henry I. and Stephen were alike incomplete:
each ignored the facts which did not suit him. John,
on the contrary, secure in possession, condescends on no
particulars, but contents himself with the terse assertion
of the fact of his kingship: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Johannes, dei gratia, Rex
Anglie</i></span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <em>The Names of the Consenting Nobles.</em> It was natural
that the Charter should place formally on record the assent
of those counsellors who attended John when he made
terms with his enemies, of those magnates who remained in at
least nominal allegiance, and were therefore capable of acting
as the mediators by whose good offices peace was for a time
restored.<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c017'><sup>[332]</sup></a> The leading men in England during this crisis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>may be arranged in three groups: (1) the leaders of the
great host openly opposed to John at Runnymede; (2) the
agents of John’s oppressions, extreme men, mostly aliens,
many of whom were in command of royal castles or of
mercenary levies ready to take the field; and (3) moderate
men, mostly churchmen or John’s ministers or relations,
who, whatever their sympathies might be, remained in
allegiance to the king and helped to arrange terms of peace—a
comparatively small band, as the paucity of names
recited in Magna Carta testifies.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c017'><sup>[333]</sup></a> The men, here made
consenters to John’s grant of Magna Carta, are again referred
to, though not by name, in chapter 63, in the character of
witnesses.</p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>The Reasons of the Grant.</i> The preamble contains
also a statement of what purport to be John’s reasons for
conceding the Charter. These are quaintly paraphrased by
Coke:<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c017'><sup>[334]</sup></a> "Here be four notable causes of the making of this
great charter rehearsed. 1. The honour of God. 2. For the
health of the King’s soul. 3. For the exaltation of holy
church, and fourthly, for the amendment of the Kingdom."
The real reason must be sought in another direction, namely,
in the army of the rebels; and John in after days did not
scruple to plead consent given under threat of violence, as a
reason for voiding his grant. The technical legal “consideration,”
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quid pro quo</i></span> which John received as the
price of this confirmation of their liberties was the renewal
by his opponents of the homage and fealty which they had
solemnly renounced. This “consideration” was not stated
in the charter, but the fact was known to all.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c017'><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c018' />
<div class='footnote' id='f322'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r322'>322</a>. The division of Magna Carta into a preamble and sixty-three chapters
is a modern device, for convenience of reference, for which there is no
warrant in the Charter itself. Cf. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>supra</i></span>, 200. No title or heading
precedes the substance of the deed in any one of the four known originals,
but on the back of the Lincoln one (cf. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>supra</i></span>, 197) these words are endorsed;—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Concordia
inter Regem Johannem et Barones pro concessione libertatum

<p class='c001'><a href='#r323'>323</a>. The sentence is concluded in chapter one (see <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>infra</i></span>)—the usual division,

<div class='footnote' id='f324'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r324'>324</a>. The phrase “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nobiles viri</i></span>” was not used here in any technical sense; the
modern conception of a distinct class of “noblemen” did not take shape
until long after 1215. Cf. what is said of “peerage” under cc. 14 and 39.</p>

neutrality of the prelates is proved by other evidence. (<i>a</i>) C. 62 gave them

Charter. (<i>b</i>) The 25th of the Articles of the Barons left to their decision

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>This first of the sixty-three chapters of Magna Carta
here places side by side, bracketed equal as it were,
(<i>a</i>) a general confirmation of the privileges of the English
national church, and (<i>b</i>) a declaration that the various civil
rights to be afterwards specified in detail were granted “to
all freemen” of the kingdom and to their heirs for ever.
The manner of this juxtaposition of the church’s rights
with the lay rights of freemen, suggests an intention to
make it clear that neither group was to be treated as
of more importance than the other. If the civil and political
rights of the nation at large occupy the bulk of the
Charter, and are defined in their minutest details, the
church’s rights, of which no mention whatever had been
made in the Articles of the Barons, receive here a prior
place.<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c017'><sup>[337]</sup></a> A twofold division thus suggests itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>The rights of the National Church.</i> A general promise
that the English church should be free was
accompanied by a special confirmation of the separate
charter recently granted guaranteeing freedom of canonical
election. (1) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Quod Anglicana ecclesia libera sit.</i></span> This
emphatic, if vague declaration, which has no counterpart
in the Articles of the Barons, is repeated twice in Magna
Carta, each time in a prominent position, at the beginning
and the end respectively. If the work of the
barons showed no special tenderness for churchmen’s privileges,
Stephen Langton and his bishops were careful to
have that defect remedied in the formal document by
which John expressed his final consent. In extorting this
promise of a “free” English church, the prelates seem to
have been satisfied that they need ask for nothing more;
the other particulars in which the Charter differs from its
draft show no trace of clerical bias. The phrase used,
indeed, was deplorably vague and elastic; it scarcely needed
stretching to cover the widest encroachments of clerical
arrogance. Yet the formula was by no means a new one;
Henry I. and Stephen had successively confirmed the claim
of holy church to its freedom.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c017'><sup>[338]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Henry II. was careful to avoid making any such promises:
his whole reign was an effort, not unsuccessful in
spite of the terrible disadvantage at which he was placed
by the murder of Becket, to deprive the church of what
her leaders considered her legitimate “freedom.” John
in 1215, however, receded from the ground occupied by
his father, confirming by the Great Charter the promise
given by the weakest of his Norman predecessors, in a
phrase repeated in all subsequent confirmations.</p>

<p class='c001'>It by no means follows that “freedom of the church,”
as promised by Stephen, meant exactly the same thing as
“freedom of the church” promised by John and his successors.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c017'><sup>[339]</sup></a>
The value to be attached to such assurances varied
in inverse ratio to the strength of the kings who made
them, and this is well illustrated by a comparison of the
charters of Henry I., Stephen, and John. Henry qualifies
the phrase by words which illustrate if they do not limit
its application. God’s holy church was to be free “<em>so
that</em> I shall neither sell nor let to farm, nor on the death
of archbishop, bishop, or abbot, accept anything from the
demesne of the church or from its tenants, until his
successor has entered into possession.”<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c017'><sup>[340]</sup></a> This suggests a
somewhat narrow interpretation of the church’s freedom—exemption
mainly from the iniquities of Rufus. Stephen’s
charter, on the contrary, explains or supplements the same
phrase by definite declarations that the bishops should have
sole jurisdiction over churchmen and their goods, and that
all rights of wardship over church lands were renounced,
thus making it a “large and dangerous promise.”<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c017'><sup>[341]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Freedom of the church” had thus come in 1136 to include
“benefit of clergy” in a specially sweeping form, and
much besides.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c017'><sup>[342]</sup></a> It is easy to understand why churchmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>cherished an elastic phrase which, wide as were the privileges
it already covered, might readily be stretched wider. Laymen,
on the contrary, contended for a more restrictive
meaning; and the Constitutions of Clarendon must be viewed
primarily as an attempt to arrive at definite conclusions on
disputed points of interpretation. Henry II. substantially
held his ground, in spite of his nominal surrender after
Becket’s murder. Thanks to his firmness, "the church’s freedom"
shrank to more reasonable proportions, so that the
well-known formula, when repeated by John, was emptied
of much of the content found in it by Stephen’s bishops.
If it still implied “benefit of clergy” that phrase was
now read in a more restricted sense, while wardship over
vacant sees was expressly reserved to the Crown by John.
Chapter 18 of Magna Carta accepted, apparently with the
approval of all classes, the principle that questions of
church patronage (assizes of darrein presentment)<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c017'><sup>[343]</sup></a> should
be settled before the King’s Justices, a concession to the
civil power inconsistent with the more extreme interpretations
formerly put by churchmen on the phrase.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c017'><sup>[344]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In later reigns the pretensions of the church to privileged
treatment were gradually reduced to narrow bounds, and
the process of compression was facilitated by that very
elasticity on which the clergy had relied as being favourable
to the expansion of their claims. It was the civil
government which benefited in the end from the vagueness
of the words in which Magna Carta declared <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quod
Anglicana ecclesia libera sit</i></span>.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c017'><sup>[345]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>(2) <i>Canonical election.</i> A separate charter to the
national church had been granted on 21st November,
1214, and re-issued on 15th January, 1215.<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c017'><sup>[346]</sup></a> Its tenor
may be given in three words, “freedom of election.” In
all cathedral and conventual churches and monasteries,
the appointment of prelates was to be free from royal
intervention for the future, provided always that licence
to fill the vacancy had first been asked of the king.
Now, <em>in words</em>, this was no new concession, but merely
a confirmation of the Concordat arrived at long before
between Henry I. and archbishop Anselm as a solution
of the rival claims of Church and State in the election
of bishops and abbots.<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c017'><sup>[347]</sup></a> The essence of that arrangement
had been to vest solely in the canons of the chapter of
the vacant diocese the nominal right to appoint the new
bishop, subject, however, to the actual election taking place
in the royal court or chapel—so that the king, being
present, might endeavour to prevent the appointment of
any churchman he objected to. The result had not been
what Anselm and the papal court expected; Henry I.
and his successors strenuously used or abused the influence
thus reserved to them: none but royal favourites were ever
appointed, and the nominally free canonical election became
a sham. Churchmen had long desired to remedy this:
Langton saw his opportunity, and on 21st November,
1214, secured from King John, so far as mere words
could secure anything, that the right of election by the
canons of the chapter should henceforth be transformed
from a pretence into a reality. The bishops present at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Runnymede used their influence to have a distinct confirmation
of this recent concession inserted in the very
forefront of Magna Carta.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their forethought was insufficient permanently to prevent
royal influence from bending canonical election to its
will. Henry III., indeed, in his reissues was made to
repeat the phrase <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quod Anglicana ecclesia libera sit</i></span>, but
omitted all reference alike to canonical election and
to the charters of 21st November, 1214, and 15th
January, 1215. Later in his reign, he took advantage
of this, with the Pope’s connivance or support, to
reduce again the rights of cathedral chapters in the
appointment of bishops to the sinecure they had been
before.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is true that Henry III. was prone, alike by nature
and from policy, to lean on the papal arm, and that the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia</i></span> at Rome rather than the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia Regis</i></span> for a time
dominated the appointment to vacant sees. Henry and
Innocent IV. indeed formed a tacit alliance for dividing
all fat livings among their respective creatures, king’s men
or pope’s men, who had little interest in England or its
welfare. Edward I., impatient of foreign dictation as he
was, had to submit to a partial continuance of “provisions”
for hangers-on of the papacy in his insular domains; but
the national church had little to gain. The canons elected
the nominee of king or pope, as each was, for the moment,
in the ascendant.<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c017'><sup>[348]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>An interesting, if purely academic, question might be
raised as to how far the rights guaranteed by Magna Carta
to the English church were meant to imply freedom from
papal as well as from royal interference. It is clear that
the movement which culminated in the charter of 21st
November, 1214, originated in England, not at Rome; and
apparently Nicholas, the papal legate at that date, opposed
the endeavours of Stephen Langton to obtain it. The archbishop
indeed looked upon the legate as the chief obstacle
to the reform by the king of the grievances of the national
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>church.<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c017'><sup>[349]</sup></a> In spite of Magna Carta, then, the independence
of the national church retrograded, rather than advanced,
during the long alliance between Henry III. and the
successive occupants of the papal throne.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c017'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Civil and Political Rights.</i> After providing thus
briefly for the church, chapter one proceeds to give equal
prominence, but at greater length, to the grant or confirmation
of secular customs and liberties. This takes here the form
of a general enacting clause, leaving details to be specified
in the remaining sixty-two chapters of the Charter. Some
of the more important points involved have already been
discussed in the Historical Introduction—for example, the
feudal form of the grant, better suited, according to modern
ideas, to the conveyance of a specific piece of land, than to
the securing of the political and civil liberties of a mighty
nation; and the vexed question as to what classes of
Englishmen were intended, under the description of “freemen,”
to participate in these rights.<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c017'><sup>[351]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another interesting point, though of minor importance,
calls for separate treatment. John does not state that his
grants of civil and political rights had been made spontaneously.
Whether deliberately or not, there is here a
marked distinction between the phraseology applied to
secular and to ecclesiastical rights respectively. While the
concessions to churchmen are said to have been granted
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mera et spontanea voluntate</i></span>,” no such statement is made
about the concessions to the freemen. John may have
favoured this omission as strengthening his contention that
the Great Charter had been sealed by him under compulsion.
In the third re-issue of Henry III. (1225) this defect was
remedied—the words “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>spontanea et bona voluntate nostra</i></span>”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>being used in its preamble.<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c017'><sup>[352]</sup></a> Some importance seems to
have been attributed to this addition, which formed the
essence of a concession bought by the surrender of one-fifteenth
of the moveable property of all estates of the
realm.</p>

chiefly as something vague, something which baffled definition, because
churchmen and laymen could never agree as to its contents, while it
tended also to vary from reign to reign. Mr. Round attempts no definition.
Sir James Ramsay (<cite>Angevin Empire</cite>, p. 475), writing of the phrase
as used in John’s Charter, is less prudent. "It would relieve the clergy
of all lay control, and of all liability to contribute to the needs of the
State beyond the occasional scutages due from the higher clergy for their
knights’ fees." This definition assuredly would not have satisfied Henry
I., as a legitimate interpretation of the words as used by him in his
Charter of Liberties.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>All preliminaries concluded, the Charter at once attacked
what was, in the barons’ eyes, the chief of John’s abuses,
his arbitrary increase of feudal obligations. The Articles
of the Barons, indeed, had plunged at once into this most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>crucial question without a word by way of pious phrases or
legal formulae, such as were necessary in a regular Charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Assessment of Beliefs.</i> Each “incident” had its own
special possibilities of abuse, and the Great Charter deals
with each of these in turn. The present chapter defines
the reliefs to be henceforth paid to John.<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c017'><sup>[353]</sup></a> The vagueness
of the sums at first was a natural corollary of the
early doubts as to whether the hereditary principle was
absolutely binding or not. The heir with title not yet
recognized was keen to come to terms. The lord took as
much as he could grind from the inexperience or timidity
of the youthful heir; the heir tried to profit from the
good nature or temporary embarrassments of the lord.
All was vague; and such vagueness favoured the strongest
or most wily.</p>

<p class='c001'>A process of definition, however, was early at work; and
progressed, though slowly. Public opinion set limits of
variation, to go beyond which was considered unreasonable
or even indecent. Some conception of a “reasonable
relief” was evolved. Yet the criterion varied: the Crown
might defy rules binding on others. Henry I., indeed,
when bidding against duke Robert in 1099 for the throne
showed himself willing, in words if not in practice, to
accept the limits set by contemporary opinion. His
Charter of Liberties promised that all reliefs should be
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>justa et legitima</i></span>—an elastic phrase no doubt, and one in
after days liberally interpreted by the exchequer officials
in their royal master’s favour. By the end of the twelfth
century, when Glanvill wrote, the exact sums which could
be taken by mesne lords had been fixed; although the
Crown remained free to exact higher rates. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Baroniae
capitales</i></span>, he tells us, were charged relief, not at a fixed
rate, but at sums which varied <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>juxta voluntatem et misericordiam
domini regis</i></span>.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c017'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Every year, however, made for definition; and custom
pointed with increasing authority towards 100s. per knight’s
fee, and £100 for a barony. Two entries on the Pipe
Roll of 10 Richard I. amusingly illustrate the unsettled
practice. A sum of £100 is described as a “reasonable
relief” for a barony, and immediately this entry is stultified
by a second entry of a considerable additional payment
by way of “fine” to induce the king to accept the sum
his own roll had just declared “reasonable.”<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c017'><sup>[355]</sup></a> John was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>more openly regardless of reason. The Pipe Roll of 1202
shows how an unfortunate heir failed to get his heritage
until he paid 300 marks, with the promise of an annual
“acceptable present” to the king.<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c017'><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If John could ask so much, what prevented him asking
more? He might name a prohibitive price, and so defeat
the hereditability of fiefs altogether. Such arbitrary exactions
must end, so the barons were determined in 1215;
custom must be defined, so as to prevail henceforth against
royal discretion. The first demand of the Articles of the
Barons is, “that heirs of full age shall have their
heritage by the ancient relief to be set forth in the
Charter.” Here it is, then, duly set forth and defined
in chapter 2 of Magna Carta as £100 for an "earl’s
barony," £100 for "a baron’s barony," 100s. for a knight’s
fee, and a proportional part of 100s. for every fraction of a
knight’s fee. This clause produced the desired effect. These
rates were strictly observed by the exchequer of Henry III.,
as we know from the Pipe Rolls of his reign. Thus, when
a certain William Pantoll was charged with £100 for his
relief on the mistaken supposition that he held a “barony,”
he protested that he held only five knight’s fees, and got off
with the payment of £25.<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c017'><sup>[357]</sup></a> The relief of a barony was
subsequently reduced from £100 to 100 marks. The
date of this change, if we may rely on Madox,<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c017'><sup>[358]</sup></a> lies between
the twenty-first and thirty-fifth years of Edward I.<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c017'><sup>[359]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Apparently all who paid reliefs to the king were mulcted
in a further payment (calculated at 9 per cent. of the
relief) in name of "Queen’s Gold," a contribution to the
private purse of the Queen Consort, and collected by an
official specially representing her at the exchequer.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c017'><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>The Charter deals only with tenure by knight’s service;
nothing is said of other tenures. The explanation of the
omission may possibly be different in the cases of socage
and of serjeanty respectively.<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c017'><sup>[361]</sup></a> (<i>a</i>) <i>Socage.</i> The barons
were not so vitally interested in socage, that being,
in the normal case, the tenure of humbler men.<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c017'><sup>[362]</sup></a> In
later reigns the king, like an ordinary mesne lord, contented
himself with one year’s rent of socage lands in name
of relief. (<i>b</i>) <i>Serjeanty.</i> The barons cannot have been
indifferent to the fate of serjeanties, since many of them
held great estates by such tenures. Possibly they assumed
that the rules applied to knights’ fees and baronies would
apply to serjeanties as well. The Crown, however, acted
on a different view; large sums were frequently extorted
by Henry III. By the reign of Edward I., however, the
practice of the exchequer was to limit itself to one
year’s rent (a sufficiently severe exaction)<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c017'><sup>[363]</sup></a> for serjeanties,
which thus fell into line with socage.<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c017'><sup>[364]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Units of Assessment.</i> Some explanation is required
of the three groups into which crown estates were thus
divided—knight’s fees, barons’ baronies, and earls’ baronies.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Feodum militis integrum.</i></span> The origin of the knight’s
fee is obscured by a network of conflicting theories. A
thread of connection is sometimes traced between it and
the mysterious five-hide unit of Anglo-Saxon times; other
authorities would ascribe its introduction into England to
a definite act of some great personage—either William the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Conqueror, according to Selden, who founds on a well-known
but untrustworthy passage in Ordericus Vitalis, or
Ranulf Flambard, according to Freeman, Stubbs, and
Gneist. It seems probable that the Normans, here as
elsewhere, pursued their policy of avoiding an open rupture
with the past, and that the Conqueror adapted as
far as possible the existing system of land tenure to his
own needs. There is little doubt, in light of the evidence
accumulated by Mr. Round in his <cite>Feudal England</cite>, that
William I. stipulated verbally for the service of a
definite number of knights from every fief bestowed by
him on his Norman followers. A knight’s fee or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>scutum</i></span>
thus became a measure of military service, and of feudal
assessment; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>servitium unius militis</i></span> was a well-known
legal unit. But a difficult problem arises when it is
asked what definite equation, if any, existed between land
and service. Three answers have been given: (<i>a</i>) A
definite ratio exists between amount of service and
extent of ground. In other words, the knight’s fee
contains a fixed area of land; every five hides sent
one warrior, thus preserving the old Anglo-Saxon unit.<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c017'><sup>[365]</sup></a>
(<i>b</i>) The ratio lies not between service and extent, but
between service and value. An estate of £20 annual
rental sends one knight to the king’s wars; the normal
knight’s fee contains 20 librates of land.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c017'><sup>[366]</sup></a> (<i>c</i>) Other
authorities deny that any proportion exists at all: William
the Conqueror exacted from each of his grantees precisely
as much or as little knight’s service as he saw fit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not possible to reconcile these divergent conclusions?
Undoubtedly the Conqueror held himself bound by no
fixed rules, but made exceptions where he pleased: some
favoured foundations were exempt from all service whatsoever.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c017'><sup>[367]</sup></a>
Yet, if he distributed estates at his own free
will, he did not necessarily distribute them irrationally or
at random. He demanded service of knights in round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>numbers, 5 or 10 or 20, as he saw cause, and in normal
cases he was guided by some loose sense of proportion.
Where there was no reason either for preferential treatment
or for special severity, service would be roughly
proportionate either to the area or to the value. This
rule was William’s servant, not his master, and was made
to yield to many exceptions, which would amply account
for the existence in later days of knight’s fees varying
from 2 hides to 14 hides, instead of the normal 5.<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c017'><sup>[368]</sup></a> Each
such fee, whatever its acreage or its rental, owed the service
of one knight, and paid relief at 100s.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>Baronia integra.</i> The word “barony” cannot be
easily defined, on account of the many changes it has
undergone.<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c017'><sup>[369]</sup></a> A “barony” at the Norman Conquest differed
in almost every respect from a “barony” at the present
day. The word <i>baro</i> was originally synonymous with
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>homo</i></span>, meaning, in feudal usage, a vassal of any lord. It
soon became usual, however, to confine the word to
king’s men; “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones</i></span>” were thus identical with "crown
tenants"—a considerable body at first; but a new distinction
soon arose between the great men and the
smaller men among their number (between <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones majores</i></span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones minores</i></span>). The latter were usually called
knights (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>milites</i></span>), while “baron” was reserved for the
holder of an “honour.”<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c017'><sup>[370]</sup></a> For determining what constituted
an “honour,” however, it was impossible to lay
down any absolute criterion. Mere size was not sufficient:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>a magnate once classed as a full “baron” might
successfully claim to be only a “knight,” thus lightening
some of his feudal burdens, for example this one of
“reliefs.” Chapter 14 of Magna Carta helped to stereotype
the division, since it stipulated that each <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>major baro</i></span>
should receive an individual writ of summons to the
Council, leaving the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones minores</i></span> to be convened collectively
through the sheriff. As the one point of certainty,
where everything else was vague, these writs came to
possess an exaggerated importance, and it was finally held
(at a date long subsequent to Magna Carta) that the mere
receipt of a special summons, if acted upon, made the
recipient a baron, and entitled his heirs, in all time
coming, to succeed him in what was fast hardening into
a recognized title of dignity. The “barons” in 1215
knew nothing of all this; they desired merely to have
the reliefs due by them taxed at a fixed rate. Each
“barony” should pay £100, a sum afterwards reduced to
100 marks.</p>

<p class='c001'>Relief was thereafter a fixed sum, while the size of the
barony varied in each case. As the same holds true of the
knight’s fee, it is doubly ridiculous to attempt to discover
an equation between the knight’s fee and the barony
founded upon the ratio of the sums payable. Coke, however,
was guilty of this absurdity.<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c017'><sup>[371]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Baronia comitis integra.</i></span> A peculiar phrase is
used in the text, an "earl’s barony" appearing where “earldom”
might be expected.<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c017'><sup>[372]</sup></a> The reason is that “earldom”
originally implied the holding of an office and not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>ownership of land, whereas relief was payable for the earl’s
lands or “honour,” not for his office. The Charter, therefore,
uses words well fitted to make its meaning clear. The
earl (or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>comes</i></span>) was the successor of the ealdorman as local
governor of a county or group of counties. His title was
official, not tenurial, or even, in early times, necessarily
hereditary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some of the ideas most intimately connected with a
modern earldom were signally inappropriate to the Norman
earls. At the present day an earldom is one of several
“steps in the peerage,” a conception that did not then
exist. At the present day it carries with it a seat in the
House of Lords, whereas no instance is recorded until long
after the Norman Conquest of any earl or other great man
demanding as a right to be present in the king’s council:
the custom of summoning all crown tenants became stereotyped
only in the reign of Henry II. and was not
formally recognized previous to chapter 14 of Magna
Carta. At the present day, again, the hereditary principle
is the chief feature of an earldom, whereas William did
not admit that the office necessarily passed from father
to son.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c017'><sup>[373]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The policy of the Conqueror had been to bring each
county as far as possible under his own direct authority;
many districts had no earls, while in others the connection
of an earl with his titular shire was reduced to a shadow,
the only points of connection being the right to enjoy “the
third penny” (that is, the third part <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro indiviso</i></span> of
the profits of justice administered in the county court)
and the right to bear its name. It is true that in addition
the earl usually held valuable estates in the shire, but he
did this only as any other landowner might. For purposes
of taxation the whole of his lands, whether in his own
county or elsewhere, were reckoned as one unit, here
described as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>baronia comitis integra</i></span>, the relief on which was
taxed at one hundred pounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very gradually in after ages, the conception of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>earldom suffered change. The official character gave way
before the idea of tenure, and later on the modern conception
was formulated of a hereditary dignity conferring
specific rank and privileges. The period of transition
when the tenurial idea prevailed is illustrated by the
successful attempt of Ranulf, earl of Chester and Lincoln,
in the reign of Henry III. to aliene one of his two
earldoms—described by him as the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>comitatus</i></span> of Lincoln.<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c017'><sup>[374]</sup></a>
Earls are now, like barons, created by letters patent, and
need not be land-owners. Thus the words “barony” and
“earldom,” so diverse in their origin and early development,
were closely united in their later history.</p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>Liability of Church Property to “Relief.”</i> The Great
Charter of John, unlike the Charter of Henry I. makes no
mention of the lands of vacant sees in this connection,
probably because the main question had long been settled
in favour of the church. The position of a bishopric was,
however, a peculiar one. Each prelate was a crown tenant,
and his fief was reckoned a “barony,” entitling its owner
to all the privileges, and saddling him with all the feudal
obligations of a baron.<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c017'><sup>[375]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was not then unnatural that, when a prelate
died, the Crown should demand “relief” from his successor,
in the same way as from the heir of a dead lay
baron. Such demands, when made by William Rufus
and his minister Flambard, met with bitter opposition.
The Crown in consequence, unwilling to forego any of its
feudal dues, endeavoured to shift their incidence from the
revenues of the see to the shoulders of the feudal under-tenants.
After bishop Wulfstan’s death on 18th January,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>1095, a writ was issued in William’s name to the freeholders
of the see of Worcester, calling on each of them to
pay, as a relief due on their bishop’s death, a specified sum,
assessed by the barons of the exchequer.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c017'><sup>[376]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In revenge for such extortions from church lands and
tenants, the historians of the day, all necessarily recruited
from the clerical class, have heartily recommended Rufus
and Flambard to the opprobrium of posterity. Anselm
compelled Henry I. to promise amendment in his coronation
Charter, which undertook to exact nothing during vacancies
either from the demesne of the church or from its tenants.<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c017'><sup>[377]</sup></a>
No corresponding promise was demanded from John, a
proof that such exactions had ceased. The Crown no longer
extorted relief from church lands, although wardship was,
without protest, enforced during vacancies.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f354'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r354'>354</a>. Glanvill’s words (IX. c. 4) are unfortunately ambiguous. He distinguishes
three cases: (<i>a</i>) the normal knight’s fee, from which 100s.
was due as relief (whether this extends to fees of crown tenants does not
appear); (<i>b</i>) socage lands, from which one year’s rent might be taken; and
(<i>c</i>) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>capitales baroniae</i></span>,” which were left subject to reliefs at the king’s
discretion. Now “barony” was a loose word: baronies, like barons,
might be small or great (cf. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>infra</i></span>, c. 14); all crown fiefs being “baronies”
in one sense, but only certain larger “honours” being so reckoned in
another. Glanvill leaves this vital point undetermined, but evidence from
other sources makes it probable that even smaller crown holdings should for
this purpose be classed under his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>capitales baroniae</i></span>, and not with knights’
fees held from mesne lords. Two passages from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dialogus de Scaccario</cite></span>
(II. x. E. p. 135 and II. xxiv. p. 155) clearly support the distinction
between all crown tenants (small as well as great) on the one hand, and
tenants of mesne lords on the other: only the latter had their reliefs fixed,
while the former were at the king’s discretion. (The second passage
shows how the exchequer officials held the onus of proof to lie on the heir
to a crown fief to show that he was worthy to succeed his father, and
suggests rich gifts to the king as the best form of proof.) Madox (I. 315-6)
cites from the Pipe Rolls large sums exacted by the crown. Usually
the number of knights’ fees paid for is not specified, but in one case
a relief of £300 was paid for six fees—that is, at the rate of £50 per fee, or
exactly ten times what a mesne lord could have exacted. (See Pipe Roll,
24 Henry II., cited by Madox, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ibid.</i></span>) There is further evidence to the
same effect: where a barony had escheated to the crown, reliefs of the
former under-tenants would in future be payable directly to the crown;
but it was the practice of Henry II. (confirmed by c. 43 of Magna Carta,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>q. v.</i></span>) to charge, in such cases, only the lower rates exigible prior to the
escheat. A similar rule applied to under-tenants of baronies in wardship;
see the case of the knights of the see of Lincoln in the hands of a royal
warden in Pipe Roll, 14 Henry II. (cited by Madox, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ibid.</i></span>). It would thus
appear that all holders of crown fiefs (not merely <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones majores</i></span>) were in
Glanvill’s day still liable to arbitrary extortions in name of reliefs. The
editors of the <cite>Dialogus</cite> (p. 223) are also of this opinion. Pollock and
Maitland (I. 289), however, maintain the opposite view—namely, that the
limitation to 100s. per knight’s fee was binding on the crown as well as
on mesne lords.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r362'>362</a>. It is possible to argue that the custom as to socage was already too
well settled to require any confirmation. Glanvill (IX. c. 4) stated the
relief for socage at one year’s annual value. It is not absolutely clear,
however, whether this restriction applied to the crown. Further, no
custom, however well established, was sufficiently safe against John’s
greed, to make confirmation unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r369'>369</a>. See Pollock and Maitland, I. 262, and authorities there cited. “An
honour or barony is thus regarded as a mass of lands which from of old
have been held by a single title.” An exact definition is, perhaps, impossible:
the term was first applied in early days without any technical
meaning; in later days each “honour” had separately established its
position by prescriptive usage. See also Pike, <cite>House of Lords</cite>, pp. 88-9,
on the difficulty of defining “an entire barony.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f370'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r370'>370</a>. This change was not complete in 1215, but Magna Carta, when it uses
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones</i></span>” alone, seems to refer to “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones majores</i></span>” only (see cc. 2, 21,
61). In c. 14, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones majores</i></span>” are contrasted with “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones

Founding on the later practice of the exchequer, which exacted one hundred
marks of relief from a barony, and one hundred shillings from a knight’s
fee, he assumed the false equation "1 barony = 13⅓ knight’s fees." If he
had known of the earlier practice, which followed the rule of John’s
Charter, he might have jumped to another equation, equally false, namely
that "1 barony = 20 knight’s fees." There is, in reality, no fixed proportion
between the two, either as to extent or value.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r374'>374</a>. See Pike, <cite>House of Lords</cite>, 63. This term <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>comitatus</i></span> was a word of many
meanings. Originally designating the “county” or “the county court,” it
came to mean also the office of the earl who ruled the county, and later on it

<p class='c001'>The Crown is here forbidden to exact relief where it
had already enjoyed wardship. It was hard on the youth,
escaping from leading-strings, to be met, when he “sued
out his livery,” with the demand for a large relief by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>exchequer which had already appropriated all his available
revenue. The same event, namely, the ancestor’s
death, was thus made the excuse for two distinct feudal
incidents.<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c017'><sup>[378]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such double extortion had long been forbidden to mesne
lords; Magna Carta was merely extending similar limitations
to the king. The grievance complained of had been
intensified by an unfair expedient which John sometimes
adopted. In cases of disputed succession he favoured the
claims of a minor, enjoyed the wardship, and thereafter
repudiated his title altogether, or confirmed it only in
return for an exorbitant fine. The only safeguard was to
provide that the king should not enjoy wardship until
he had allowed the heir to perform homage, which
constituted the binding tie of lord and vassal between them,
prevented the king from challenging the vassal’s right, and
bound him to “warrant” the title against all rival claimants.
This expedient was actually adopted in the revised Charter
of 1216.<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c017'><sup>[379]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The alterations in that reissue were not altogether in
the vassal’s favour. Another addition made a reasonable
stipulation in favour of the lord, which incidentally illustrates
the theory underlying wardship. The essence of
tenure in chivalry was the grant of land in return for
military services. Only a knight was capable of bearing
arms; hence it was that the lord held the lands in
ward until the minor should reach man’s estate. Ingenious
attempts had apparently been made to defeat these
legitimate rights of feudal lords by making the infant heir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>a “knight,” thus cutting away the basis on which wardship
rested. The reissue of 1216 prevented this, providing that
the lands of a minor should remain in wardship, although
he was made a knight.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c017'><sup>[380]</sup></a> Incidentally, the same Charter
of Henry declared twenty-one years to be the period at
which a military tenant came of age, a point on which
John’s Charter had been silent.</p>

<p class='c001'>In one case, exceptionally, wardship and relief might
both be exacted on account of the same death, though not
by the same lord. Where the dead man had formerly held
two estates, one of the Crown and one of a mesne lord, the
Crown might claim the wardship of both, and then the
disappointed mesne lord was allowed to exact relief as
a solatium for his loss.<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c017'><sup>[381]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c018' />
<div class='footnote' id='f378'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r378'>378</a>. Where there had already been a wardship, the relief was thus the price
paid by the heir in order to escape from the heavy hand of the king, and
was therefore known as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ousterlemain</i></span>.” Mr. Taswell-Langmead (<cite>Engl.
Const. Hist.</cite>, p. 51, n.) states the amount at half a year’s profits. He cites
no authorities for this, and is probably in error. The <cite>Dialogus</cite>, II. x. E.,

<p class='c001'>This chapter and the next treat of wardship,<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c017'><sup>[382]</sup></a> a much
hated feudal incident, which undoubtedly afforded openings
for grave abuses. It is a mistake, however, to regard
its mere existence as an abuse: it seems to have been
perfectly legal in England from the date of the Norman
Conquest, although some writers<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c017'><sup>[383]</sup></a> consider it an innovation
devised by William Rufus and Flambard, without precedent
in the Conqueror’s reign. The chief argument for this
mistaken view is that Henry I., in promising redress of
several admitted inventions of Rufus, promised also to
reform wardship. This may show that wardship was
abused, but does not prove it an innovation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Charter of Henry committed him undoubtedly
to drastic remedies, which would have amounted to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>virtual abolition of wardship altogether. Chapter 4 of
that document removed from the lord’s custody both
the land and the person of the heir, and gave them
to the widow of the deceased tenant (or to one of the
kinsmen, if such kinsman had, by ancient custom,
rights prior to those of the widow).<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c017'><sup>[384]</sup></a> This was only one
of the many insincere promises which the “lion of
justice” never kept, and probably never meant to keep.
Wardship continued to be exacted from lay fiefs throughout
the reigns of Henry I. and Stephen. Article 4 of the
Assize of Northampton (1176) merely confirmed the existing
practice when it allowed wardship to the lord of the
fee.<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c017'><sup>[385]</sup></a> The barons in 1215 made no attempt to alter
this, or to revert to the drastic remedies of the Charter
of Henry I., although the evils complained of had become
worse under John’s misgovernment.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be remembered that “wardship” placed the
property and person of the heir at the mercy of the Crown.
Even if the popular belief as to the fate met by Prince
Arthur at his uncle’s hands was unfounded, John was by
no means the guardian to inspire confidence in the widowed
mother of a young Crown tenant whose estates the king
might covet for himself. Further, the king might confer
the office, with the delicate issues involved, upon whomsoever
he would. When such a trust was abused it was difficult
to obtain redress. In 1133 a guardian, accused <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de puella
quam dicitur violasse in custodia sua</i></span>, paid a fine to the crown,
if not as hush money, at least in order to obtain protection
from being sued elsewhere than in the <cite>Curia Regis</cite>.<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c017'><sup>[386]</sup></a> It
is easy to understand how thoroughly this feudal incident
must have been detested in England and Normandy, all
the more so if, as Hallam contends, it was not recognized
as a feudal due in other parts of Europe.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c017'><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Guardians were of two kinds. The king might entrust
the lands to the sheriff of the county where they lay
(or to one of his bailiffs), such sheriff drawing the revenues
on the Crown’s behalf, and accounting in due season
at the exchequer. Alternatively, the king might make
an out-and-out grant of the office, together with all profit
to be derived from it, to a private individual, either some
royal favourite or the bidder of the highest price. Commentators
of a later date<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c017'><sup>[388]</sup></a> apply the word “committee”
to the former type of guardian, reserving “grantee” for
the latter. This distinction, which is mentioned by
Glanvill,<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c017'><sup>[389]</sup></a> obtains recognition in this passage of the Charter.
Neither was likely to have the interests of the minor at
heart. Both would extort the maximum of revenue, the
one for the king, the other for himself. They had always
strong inducements to exhaust the soil, stock, and timber,
uprooting and cutting down whatever would fetch a price,
and replacing nothing. The heir found too often a wilderness
of impoverished lands and empty barns.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remedies proposed by Magna Carta were too timid
and half-hearted; yet something was effected. It was
unnecessary to repeat the recognized rule that the minor
must receive, out of the revenues of the land, maintenance
and education suited to his station; but the Crown was
restrained by chapter 3 from exacting relief where wardship
had already been enjoyed; chapter 37 forbade John
to exact wardship in certain cases where it was not legally
due; while here in chapter 4 an attempt was made to
protect the estate from waste.</p>

<p class='c001'>The promised reforms included a definition of “waste”;
punishment of the wasteful guardian; and protection
against repetition of the abuse. Each of these calls for
comment. (1) <i>The definition of waste.</i> The Charter uses
the words “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vastum hominum vel rerum</i></span>” (a phrase which
occurs also in Bracton).<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c017'><sup>[390]</sup></a> It is easy to understand waste
of goods; but what is "waste of men"? An answer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>may be found in the words of the so-called “unknown
Charter of Liberties,”<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c017'><sup>[391]</sup></a> which binds guardians to hand
over the land to the heir “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sine venditione nemorum et
sine redemptione hominum</i></span>.” Clearly, to enfranchise villeins
was one method of “wasting men.” The young heir,
when he came to the enjoyment of his estates, must not
find his praedial serfs emancipated.<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c017'><sup>[392]</sup></a> The words of the
“unknown Charter” may be used to illustrate the text,
even if it be a forgery, since a consensus of opinion holds
it to be either contemporary or of slightly later date.<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c017'><sup>[393]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>The punishment of wasteful guardians.</i> The Charter
provides a distinct but appropriate form of punishment
for each of the two types of guardian. John promises
to take “amends,” doubtless of the nature of a fine,
from the “committee” who had no personal interest in
the property; while the “grantee” is to forfeit the
guardianship, thus losing a valuable asset for which he
had probably paid a high price, sufficient punishment,
perhaps, without the exaction of damages.</p>

<p class='c001'>Subsequent statutes did not, however, take so lenient
a view. While the Statute of Westminster<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c017'><sup>[394]</sup></a> merely repeated
the words of Magna Carta, the Statute of Gloucester<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c017'><sup>[395]</sup></a>
enacted that the grantee who had committed waste
should not only lose the custody, but should, in addition,
pay to the heir any balance between the value of the
wardship thus forfeited and the total damage. More
severe penalties were found necessary. Statute 36
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Edward III. chapter 13 enacted that the king’s Escheators
(officers who first became prominent towards
the close of the reign of Henry III., and who acted in
the normal case as guardians of Crown wards), when
guilty of waste, should “yield to the heir treble damages.”
If the boy was still a minor, his friends might bring a
suit on his behalf; or after he was of full age he might
bring it on his own account.<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c017'><sup>[396]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <i>Provision against a recurrence of the waste.</i> It
was only fair that reasonable precautions should be taken
to prevent the heir who had already suffered hurt, from
being similarly abused a second time. John, accordingly,
promised to supersede the keeper guilty of waste by
appointing as guardians two of the most trustworthy
of the free-holders on the heir’s estate. These men,
from their local and personal ties to the young heir,
might be expected to deal tenderly with his property.
The “unknown Charter,” already referred to, proposed a
more drastic remedy. Whenever the Crown’s right to
a wardship opened, the lands were to be entrusted to
four knights of the fief without waiting until damage had
been done. This suggestion, if carried out, would have
protected the king’s wards, without injury to the legitimate
pecuniary interests of the Crown.</p>

this statute, holding that the heir who suffered damage could not, on
coming of age, obtain such triple damages, or indeed any damages at
all, if the king had previously taken amends himself. Coke further
maintains that even after waste had been committed, the person of the
heir was left in the power of the unjust guardian, explaining that when the
Charter took away the office “this is understood of the land, and
not of the body.” There seems, however, to be no authority for such
statements.</p>

<p class='c001'>These stipulations form the complement, on the positive

was not sufficient to prohibit acts of waste; the guardian
must see that the estates were kept in good repair.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>The Obligations of the Warden of a Lay-fief.</i> It was
the duty of every custodian to preserve the lands from
neglect, together with all houses, “parks” (a term explained
under chapter 47), fishponds, mills, and the other usual
items of the equipment of a medieval manor. All outlays
required for these purposes formed, in modern language,
a first charge on the revenues of the estate, to be deducted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>before the balance was appropriated by the “grantee,” or
paid to the exchequer by the “committee.” It was the
guardian’s duty, moreover, to restore the whole to the
heir in as good condition as the produce of the land
might reasonably permit. Henry’s Charters directed that the
guardian should redeliver the land stocked with ploughs
“and with all other appointments in at least as good
condition as he received it.”<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c017'><sup>[398]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Magna Carta did not attempt to abolish wardship, which
continued in full force for many centuries, with only a
few of its worst abuses somewhat curtailed. The whole
subject was regulated in 1549 by the Statute 32 Henry
VIII. c. 46, which instituted the Court of Wards and
Liveries, the expensive and dilatory procedure of which
caused increasing discontent, until an order of both Houses
of Parliament, dated 24th February, 1646, abolished it
along with “all wardships, liveries, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>primer seisins</i></span>, and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ouster les mains</i></span>.”<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c017'><sup>[399]</sup></a> This ordinance was confirmed at
the Restoration by the Statute 12 Charles II. c. 24.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Wardships over Vacant Sees.</i> The church had its
own grievances, although these took a different form.
The Constitutions of Clarendon<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c017'><sup>[400]</sup></a> had stipulated that each
great prelate should hold his Crown lands <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sicut baroniam</i></span>;
and this view ultimately prevailed. It followed that all
appropriate feudal burdens affected church fiefs equally with
lay fiefs. The lands which formed the temporalities of a
see were, however, in a peculiar position, being the property,
not of an individual, but of an undying corporation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>(to use the definite language of a later age). When
one bishop or abbot died, a successor of suitable age
and worth had at once to be appointed. A minority was
thus impossible, and therefore, so it might be argued,
wardships could never arise. Rufus objected to what
he thought an unfair exemption from a recognized feudal
incident. Flambard devised an ingenious substitute for
ordinary wardships by keeping sees long vacant, and
meantime taking the lands under the guardianship of
the Crown. Such practices formed the original ground
of quarrel between Anselm and Rufus. Henry I.,
while renouncing by his Charter all pretensions to exact
reliefs, retained his right of wardship, promising merely
that vacant sees should neither be sold nor farmed
out. Stephen went further, renouncing expressly all wardships
over church lands; but Henry II. ignored this concession,
and reverted to the practice of his grandfather.
In his reign the wardship of the rich properties of vacant
sees formed a valuable asset of the exchequer. During
a vacancy the Crown drew not only the rents and issues
of the soil, but also the various feudal payments which
the under-tenants would otherwise have paid to the bishop.
The Pipe Roll of 14 Henry II.<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c017'><sup>[401]</sup></a> records sums of £30
and £20 paid into the exchequer by two tenants of the
vacant see of Lincoln for six and four knight’s fees
respectively.<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c017'><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The practice of Henry of Anjou was followed by his
sons. John was careful specially to reserve wardships over
vacant sees even in that very accommodating charter, dated
21st November, 1214, which surrendered the right of
canonical election to the national church. Stephen
Langton had either failed to force John to relinquish
wardships or else considered such a concession unnecessary
now that the king renounced his right to veto
church appointments, since wardships over church lands
would become unprofitable if elections were never unduly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>delayed. Whatever the reason, the charter of 1214 did
nothing to guard against the abuse of wardships over
church lands, and John’s Great Charter was equally silent.<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c017'><sup>[403]</sup></a>
The omission was supplied in 1216, when it was directed
that the provisions already made applicable to lay fiefs
should extend also to vacant sees, with the added proviso
that church wardships should never be sold. The charter
of Henry III. thus reverted to the exact position defined by
the charter of Henry I. The lands of vacant sees might be
placed under a “committee,” but never given to a “grantee,”
to use Coke’s terms.</p>

<p class='c001'>These provisions were further supplemented by later acts.
An Act of 14 Edward III. (stat. 4, cc. 4 and 5) gave to the
dean and chapter of a vacant see a right to the pre-emption
of the wardship at a fair price. If they failed to exercise
this, the king’s right to appoint escheators or other
keepers was confirmed, but under strict rules as to waste.
This is a distinct confirmation of the king’s right to
“commit” church lands, although the prohibitions against
selling them or farming them out remained still in force.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Crown’s right to regulate the marriages of wards
had become an intolerable grievance. The origin of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>feudal incident and its extension to male as well as female
minors have been elsewhere explained.<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c017'><sup>[404]</sup></a> John made a
regular traffic in the sale of wards—young maids of fourteen
and aged widows alike. No excuse would be accepted.
The Pipe Roll of John’s first year<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c017'><sup>[405]</sup></a> records how the
chattels of a certain Alice Bertram were taken from her and
sold because she refused “to come to marry herself” at the
summons of the king. Only two expedients were open to
those who objected to mate for life with the men to
whom John sold them. They might take the veil, become
dead in law, and forfeit their fiefs to escape the
burdens inherent in them. Only the cloister could afford
them shelter; nowhere in the outer world were they safe.
The other way of escape was to outbid objectionable
suitors. This was not always possible, for John was
predisposed to favour the suit of his foreign gentlemen
of fortune, thus befriending his creatures while adding to
the slender number of personally loyal tenants-<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in-capite</i></span>.
John’s greed was insatiable, and brief entries in his Exchequer
Rolls condense the story of many a tragedy. In
the first year of his reign the widow of Ralph of Cornhill
offered 200 marks, with three palfreys and two hawks,
that she might not be espoused by Godfrey of Louvain,
but remain free to marry whom she chose, and yet keep
her lands. This was a case of desperate urgency, since
Godfrey, for love of the lady or of her lands, had offered
400 marks for her, if she could show no reason to the
contrary. It is satisfactory to learn that in this case
the higher bribe was refused, and the lady escaped.<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c017'><sup>[406]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes John varied his practice by selling, not the
woman herself, but the <em>right</em> to sell her. In 1203 Bartholomew
de Muleton bought for 400 marks the wardship
of the lands and heir of a certain Lambert, along with the
widow, to be married to whom he would, yet so that
she should not be disparaged.<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c017'><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Great stress was naturally placed on exemption from
"disparagement"—that is, from forced marriage with one
who was not an equal. When William of Scotland, by
the treaty of 7th February, 1212, conferred on John the
right to marry Prince Alexander to whom he would, the
qualification was expressly stated, “but always without
disparagement.”<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c017'><sup>[408]</sup></a> Such a proviso was understood where
not expressed, and formed apparently the only restriction
admitted by the Crown upon this prerogative. It is not
surprising, then, to find it specially confirmed in Magna
Carta. The Articles of the Barons had, indeed, demanded a
further protection—namely, that a royal ward should only
be married <em>with the consent</em> of the next of kin. In our text
this is softened down to the mere intimation of an intended
marriage. The opportunity was thus afforded of protesting
against an unsuitable match. Insufficient as the provision
was, it was entirely omitted from the reissues of Henry’s
reign. The sale of heiresses went on unchecked.</p>

<p class='c001'>Magna Carta made no attempt to define disparagement,
but the Statute of Merton<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c017'><sup>[409]</sup></a> gave two examples,—marriage
to a villein or to a burgess. This was not an exhaustive
list. Littleton, commenting on this statute,<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c017'><sup>[410]</sup></a> adds other illustrations:—“as
if the heir that is in ward be married to one
who hath but one foot, or but one hand, or who is deformed,
decrepit, or having an horrible disease, or else great and
continual infirmity, and, if he be an heir male, married to
a woman past the age of child-bearing.” Plenty of room
was left for forcing on a ward an objectionable husband or
wife, who yet could not be proved to come within the law’s
definition of “disparagement.” The barons argued in 1258
that an English heiress was disparaged if married to anyone
not an Englishman by birth.<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c017'><sup>[411]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Was it in the power of the far-seeing father of a prospective
heiress by marrying her during his own life-time to
render nugatory the Crown’s right to nominate a husband?
Not entirely; for the Charter of Henry I. (even when renouncing
the more oppressive practice of Rufus) reserved
the king’s right to be consulted by the barons before they
bestowed the hand of female relations in marriage. Magna
Carta is silent on the point, and the presumption is that
the existing law was to be maintained.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bracton<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c017'><sup>[412]</sup></a> explains that law:—No woman with an inheritance
could marry without the chief lord’s consent,
under pain of losing such inheritance; yet the lord when
asked was bound to grant consent, if he failed to show good
reasons to the contrary; he could not, however, be compelled
to accept homage from an enemy or other unsuitable
tenant. The Crown’s rights in such matters were apparently
the same as those of any mesne lord.<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c017'><sup>[413]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r411'>411</a>. See Petition of Barons (<cite>Sel. Charters</cite>, 383). Gradually the conception
of disparagement was expanded, partly from the natural development of
legal principles and partly from the increased power the nobility obtained
of enforcing their own definitions upon the king. Coke commenting on
Littleton (Section 107) mentions four kinds of disparagements: (1) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>propter
vitium animi</i></span>, <i>e.g.</i> lunatics and others of unsound mind; (2) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>propter

aliens, or children of aliens; (3) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>propter vitium corporis</cite></span>, as those who had
lost a limb or were diseased or impotent; and (4) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>propter jacturam
privilegii</i></span>, or such a marriage as would involve loss of “benefit of clergy.”
The last clause had no possible connection with the law as it stood in
the thirteenth century, but was founded on the fact that marriage with
a widow or widower was deemed by the Church in later days an act
of bigamy, and therefore involved loss of the benefit of clergy, until this
was remedied by the Statute 1 Edward VI. c. 12 (sect. 16).</p>

wide and vague. She might indeed, if deprived of her

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>I. <i>The Widow’s Share of Real Estate.</i> Three words are
used:—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dos</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>maritagium</i></span>, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>hereditas</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>Dower.</i> A wife’s dower is the portion of her
husband’s lands set aside to support her in her widowhood.
It was customary from an early date for a bridegroom to
make adequate provision for his bride on the day he
married her. Such a ceremony, indeed, formed a picturesque
feature of the marriage rejoicings, taking place literally at
the door of the church, as man and wife returned from the
altar. The share of her husband’s land thus set apart for
the young wife was known as her <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dos</i></span> (or dowry), and would
support her if her husband died. In theory the transaction
between the spouses partook of the nature of a contract by
which they arranged the extent of the provision to be given
and accepted. The wife’s rôle, however, was a passive one;
her concurrence was assumed. Yet, if no provision was
made at all, the law stepped in, on the presumption
that the omission had been unintentional on the
husband’s part, and fixed the dower at one-third of all
his lands.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c017'><sup>[415]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John’s Magna Carta contents itself with the brief enactment
“that a widow shall have her dower.” The Charter
of 1217 goes farther, containing an exact statement of the
law as it then stood:—"The widow shall have assigned to
her for her dower the third part of all her husband’s land
which he had in his lifetime (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in vita sua</i></span>) unless a smaller
share had been given her at the door of the church."
Lawyers of a later age have by a strained construction
of the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in vita sua</i></span>, made them an absolute protection
to a wife against all attempts of her husband to defeat or
lessen her dower by alienations granted without her consent
during the subsistence of the marriage.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c017'><sup>[416]</sup></a> Magna Carta
contains no warrant for such a proposition, although a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>later clause (chapter 11) secures the dower lands from
attachment by the husband’s creditors, whether Jews or
others.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Maritagium.</i></span> It was customary for a land-owner to
bestow some share of his property as a marriage portion
upon his daughters, that they might not come to their
husbands as empty-handed brides. The land so granted
was usually relieved from all burdens of service and
homage. It was hence known as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liberum maritagium</i></span>, which
almost came to be recognized as a separate form of feudal
tenure. Grants for this purpose could be made without the
consent of the tenant’s expectant heirs, although early
English law absolutely prohibited alienation of lands for
any other purpose without their consent. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Maritagium</i></span> was
thus “a provision for a daughter—or perhaps some other
near kinswoman—and her issue.”<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c017'><sup>[417]</sup></a> The husband of the
lady was, during the marriage, treated as virtual owner
for all practical purposes; but on his death the widow had
an indisputable title to lands brought with her “in free
marriage.”<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c017'><sup>[418]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The obvious meaning, however, has not always been
appreciated. Coke<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c017'><sup>[419]</sup></a> reads the clause as allowing to
widows of under-tenants a right denied (by chapter 8) to
widows of Crown tenants—namely “freedom to marry where
they will without any licence or assent of their lords.”
This interpretation is inherently improbable, since the
barons at Runnymede desired to place restrictions on their
enemy, the king, not upon themselves; and it is opposed to
the law of an earlier reign, as expounded by Bracton.<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c017'><sup>[420]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Daines Barrington<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c017'><sup>[421]</sup></a> invents an imaginary rule of law in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>order to explain a supposed exception. An ordinary widow,
he declares, could not in the normal case marry again before
the expiry of a year after her first husband’s death. Some
widows, however, were specially privileged. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Maritagium</i></span>
was a right conferred on widows of land-owners to cut
short the period of mourning imposed on others. This is a
complete inversion of the truth; the possession of land
always restricted, instead of extending, freedom of marriage.
Several later authorities follow Barrington’s mistake.<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c017'><sup>[422]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such mistakes when made by recent writers are the more
inexcusable in view of the clear explanation given a century
ago by John Reeves,<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c017'><sup>[423]</sup></a> who distinguished between two kinds
of marriage portion: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liberum maritagium</i></span>, whence no service
whatever was exigible for three generations, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>maritagium
servitio obnoxium</i></span>, liable to the usual services from the first,
although exempt from homage until after the death of the
third heir.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c017'><sup>[424]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Hereditas.</i></span> The first two words are thus readily
understood: but what is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>hereditas</i></span>? Is it simply another
name for one of these, or is it something different? It is
possibly used to denote estates acquired by the wife, not as
a marriage portion, but in any other way, for example by
the opening of a succession on the death of someone, her
father or other relative, of whom she is the heir.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>The Widow’s Share of Personal Estate.</i> The chapter of
the Charter at present under discussion says nothing as to
the widow’s right to any portion of her deceased husband’s
goods and chattels. Chapter 26, however, confirms the
existing law which secured to her, in the normal case,
one third of her husband’s personal estate, as will be
more fully explained hereafter.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>III. <i>Provision for the Widow’s immediate Needs.</i> Many
intricate questions might arise before it was possible to
divide the land into aliquot portions and so “assign” the
exact one-third due to her. Meanwhile, temporary provision
must be made for her support. This was of two
kinds: (1) <i>Quarantine.</i> Magna Carta confirmed her
right to remain in the family home for a space of
forty days. This was known to later lawyers as the
widow’s quarantine.<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c017'><sup>[425]</sup></a> The Charter of 1216 notes an
exception to the general rule, on which John’s Charter is
silent: if the deceased husband’s chief place of residence
had been a castle, the widow could not stay there; feudal
strongholds were not for women. In such cases, however,
so the reissue of 1216 carefully provided, another residence
must be immediately substituted. In later days, widows
unlawfully deprived of their quarantine were provided with
a remedy by means of a writ, known as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de quarentina
habenda</i></span>,” directing the sheriff to take summary procedure
to do her right.<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c017'><sup>[426]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>Estovers of Common.</i> The widow required something
more than the protection of a roof; for, until her
dower lands had been delivered to her, no portion of the
produce of her late husband’s manors could be strictly
called her own. The estate was held “in common”
between her and her husband’s heir (or between her and
the “guardian” of that heir’s estates). It was only fair
that, until her rights were ascertained, she should
be allowed a reasonable share of the produce. Neither
John’s Charter nor the first issue of Henry III. said
anything on this head. The reissue of 1217 supplied
the omission, expressly confirming the widow of a Crown
tenant in the right to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rationabile estoverium suum interim de
communi</i></span>. Many explanations of the word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>estovers</i></span> (generally
used in the plural) might be cited: from Dr. Johnson,
who defines it broadly as “necessaries allowed by law,” to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Dr. Stubbs, who narrows it to “firewood.”<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c017'><sup>[427]</sup></a> It was the
right to use certain parts of the natural produce of land or
other property for the supply of one’s personal or domestic
wants. Such rights varied in extent, however; from the
general right to a full supply of all things necessary for
the maintenance of life, down to the restricted right to take
one kind of produce for one specific purpose only.<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c017'><sup>[428]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It seems natural to infer that in this passage of Magna
Carta the word bears its wider signification. Such was
Coke’s view,<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c017'><sup>[429]</sup></a> who held that it implied the widow’s right
to “sustenance” of every kind, including the right to kill
such oxen on the manor as she required for food. Estovers
“of common” should thus be read as extending the widow’s
right of consumption for her own and her household’s
use over every form of produce held “in common” by
her and the heir’s guardian prior to a final division.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c017'><sup>[430]</sup></a></p>

the marriage were heirs to the lands and would hold them as tenants

nor homage was due. After the third transmission, the land ceased to
be specially “free”; the peculiar tenure came to an end; and the new
owner was subject to all the usual burdens of an ordinary tenant.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f428'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r428'>428</a>. Several instances of the wider use of the word may be given. Bracton
(III. <i>folio</i> 137) explains that, pending the trial of a man accused of felony,
his lands and chattels were set aside by the sheriff until it was determined
whether they were to become the king’s property by the conviction of the
accused; meanwhile the imprisoned man and his family out of the revenue
received “reasonable estovers.” (Cf. <i>infra</i>, c. 32.) The Statute of Gloucester
(6 Edward I. c. 4) mentions incidentally one method of stipulating
for a return from property alienated, viz., to take the grantee bound to
provide the grantor in estovers of meat or clothes. (“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>A trouver estovers en
vivre ou en vesture</i></span>”). Blackstone again (<cite>Commentaries</cite>, I. 441) applies the
name <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>estovers</i></span> to the alimony or allowance made to a divorced woman "for
her support out of the husband’s estate." Sometimes, however, the word
was used in a more restricted sense. Coke (<cite>Second Institute</cite>, p. 17) says,
"when <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>estovers</i></span> are restrained to woods, it signifieth housebote, hedgebote,
and ploughbote,"—that is, such timber as was required for repairing
houses, hedges, and ploughs. Apparently it had an even more restricted
scope when used to describe the right of those who dwelt in the king’s
forests, viz., to take dead timber as firewood. (Cf. <i>infra</i>, c. 44.)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f429'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r429'>429</a>. <cite>Second Institute</cite>, p. 17.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f430'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r430'>430</a>. There seems no reason to restrict her estovers to a right over “commons,”
in the sense of pastures and woods held “in common” by her late
husband and the villeins of his manor. Some such meaning, indeed,
attaches to the phrase “dower of estovers” met with in later reigns, <i>e.g.</i>
in <cite>Year Book</cite> of 2 Edward II. (Selden Society), p. 58, where it was held that
such a right (claimed as a permanent part of dower) did <em>not</em> belong to a widow.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wealthy ladies, who were wise, were glad to escape
with their children from John’s clutches by agreeing to
buy up all the Crown’s oppressive rights for a lump sum.
In the very year of Magna Carta, Margaret, the widow of
Robert fitz Roger, paid £1000;<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c017'><sup>[431]</sup></a> and a few years earlier
Petronilla, Countess of Leicester, expended as much as
4000 marks.<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c017'><sup>[432]</sup></a> Though the circumstances of each of these
cases seem to have been peculiar, the Pipe Rolls contain
numerous smaller sums; in 1206 Juliana, widow of John
of Kilpec, accounts for 50 marks and a palfrey.<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c017'><sup>[433]</sup></a> Horses,
dogs, and falcons were frequently given in addition to
money fines, and testify eloquently to the greed of the
king, the anxiety of the victims, and the extortionate nature
of the whole system. In return, formal charters were
usually obtained, a good example of which is one granted
to Alice, countess of Warwick, dated 13th January, 1205,<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c017'><sup>[434]</sup></a>
containing many concessions; among others that she should
not be forced to marry; that she should be sole guardian of
her sons; that she should have one-third part of her late husband’s
lands as her reasonable dower; and that she should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>be quit from attendance at the courts of the shire and
of the hundred, and from payment of sheriff’s aids during
her widowhood. Another charter of 20th April, 1206,
shows what a widow had to expect if she failed to make
her bargain with the Crown. John granted to Richard
Fleming, an alien as his name implies, and presumably
one of his not too reputable mercenaries, the wardship
of the lands of the deceased Richard Grenvill with the
rights of marriage of the widow and children.<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c017'><sup>[435]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Magna Carta sought to substitute a general rule of law
for the provisions of these private charters purchased by
individuals at ruinous expenditure. It contained no startling
innovations, but only repeated at greater length the
promises made (and never kept) by Henry I. in the relative
part of clause 4 of his coronation charter. No widow was
to be constrained to marry again against her will. This
liberty must not be used, however, to the prejudice of
the Crown’s lawful rights. Although the widow need not
marry as a second husband the man chosen by the king
without her consent, neither could she marry without
the king’s consent the man of her own choice. Magna
Carta specially provided that she must find security to
this effect, an annoying, but not unfair, stipulation. The
Crown, in later days, compelled the widow, when having
her dower assigned to her in Chancery, to swear not to
marry without licence; and if she broke her oath, she had
to pay a fine, which was finally fixed at one year’s value of
her dower.<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c017'><sup>[436]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The Charter now passes to another group of grievances.
Chapters 9 to 11 treat of the kindred topics of debts,
usury, and the Jews, and should be read in connection
with each other, and with chapter 26, which regulates the
procedure for attaching the personal estate of deceased
Crown tenants who were also Crown debtors. The present
chapter, although quite general in its terms, had special
reference to cases where the Crown was the creditor;
while the two following chapters treated more particularly
of debts contracted to Jews or other money lenders.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact that John’s subjects owed debts to his exchequer
did not, of course, imply that they had borrowed
money from the king. The sums entered as due in the
Rolls of the Exchequer represented obligations which had
been incurred in many different ways. What with feudal
incidents and scutages, and indiscriminate fines, so heavy
in amount that they could only be paid by instalments,
a large proportion of Englishmen must have been permanently
indebted to the Crown. At John’s accession
most of the northern barons still owed the scutages demanded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>by Richard. John remitted none of the arrears,
while imposing new burdens of his own: the attempts
made to collect these debts intensified the friction between
John and his barons.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c017'><sup>[437]</sup></a> It was, further, the Crown’s practice
wherever possible, to make its debtors find sureties for
their debts, thus widening the circle of those liable to
distraint, while the officers who enforced payment were
guilty of irregularities, which became the cloaks of grave
abuses.</p>

<p class='c001'>Three equitable rules were laid down. (1) The personal
estate of a debtor must be exhausted before his real
estate or its revenues were attacked. To take away his
land might deprive him ultimately of his means of livelihood,
since the chattels left to him could not yield a
permanent revenue.<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c017'><sup>[438]</sup></a> The rule here laid down by Magna
Carta has not found a place in modern systems of law,
which usually leave the option with the creditor.
(2) The estate (both real and personal) of the chief
debtor had to be exhausted before proceedings could be
instituted against his sureties. Magna Carta thus enunciated
in English law a rule which has found favour in
most systems of jurisprudence. The man who is only
a surety for another’s debt is entitled to immunity until
the creditor has taken all reasonable steps against the
principal debtor. Such a right is known to the civil law
as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>beneficium ordinis</i></span>, and to modern Scots law as the
“benefit of discussion.” (3) If these sureties had, after
all, to pay the debt in whole or in part, they were
allowed “a right of relief” against the principal debtor,
being put in possession of his lands and rents. This rule
has some analogy with the equitable principle of modern
law, which gives to the surety who has paid his principal’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>debt, the right to whatever property the creditor held in
security of that debt.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even when the Crown’s bailiffs obeyed Magna Carta
by leaving land alone when chattels were available, they
might still wantonly inflict terrible hardship upon debtors.
Sometimes they seized goods valuable out of all proportion
to the debt; and an Act of 1266<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c017'><sup>[439]</sup></a> forbade this
practice when the disproportion was “outrageous.”
Sometimes they attempted to extort prompt payment or
to ruin their victim by selecting whatever chattel was
most indispensable to him. Oxen were taken from the
plough and allowed to die of starvation and neglect.
The practice of the exchequer, in the days of Henry II.,
had been more considerate; oxen were to be spared as
far as possible where other personal effects were available.<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c017'><sup>[440]</sup></a>
John’s charter has no such humane provision,<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c017'><sup>[441]</sup></a> and the
abuse continued. The Act of 1266, already cited, forbade
officers to chase away the owner who came to feed his
impounded cattle at his own expense. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Articuli super
cartas</i></span><a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c017'><sup>[442]</sup></a> went further; prohibiting the seizure of beasts
of the plough altogether so long as other effects
might be attached of sufficient value to satisfy the
debt.<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c017'><sup>[443]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The taking of usury, denied by law to Christians, was
carried on by Jews under great disadvantages and risks;
and the rates of interest were proportionately high, ranging
in normal cases from two to four pence per pound

ten or twenty-fold.<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c017'><sup>[447]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Magna Carta prevented this great injustice to the ward;
but, in doing so, inflicted, according to modern standards,
some injustice on the money-lenders. During the minority
no interest at all, it was provided, should accrue to Jew
or other usurer; while, if the debt passed to the Crown,
the king must not use his prerogative to extort more
than a private debtor might; he must confine himself to
the principal sum specified in the document of debt. The
provision that no interest should run during minorities
was confirmed by the Statute of Merton,<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c017'><sup>[448]</sup></a> which made
it clear, however, that its provisions should not operate
as a discharge of the principal sum or of the interest
which had accrued before the ancestor’s death. The Statute
of Jewry, of uncertain date,<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c017'><sup>[449]</sup></a> made interest irrecoverable
by legal process. All previous acts against usury were
repealed by the statute 37 Henry VIII. c. 9, which,
however, forbade the exaction of interest at a higher rate
than 10 per cent., and this remained the legal rate until
reduced to 8 per cent, by 21 James I. c. 17. Money-lending
and the usury laws are subjects closely bound
up with the repressive measures against the Jews.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>The History of the Jews in England.</i> The policy
of the Crown towards those aliens of the Hebrew race who
sought its protection varied at different times, and three
periods may be distinguished. From the Norman Conquest
to the coronation of Richard I. the Jews were fleeced
and tolerated; during the reigns of Richard and John
and the minority of Henry III. they were fleeced and
protected; and finally they were fleeced and persecuted,
this last stage extending from the formation of the alliance
between Henry and Innocent IV. down to the ordinance
of 1290, which banished in perpetuity all Jews from
England. The details of this long story of hardship and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>oppression, tempered fitfully by royal clemency, which had
always to be well paid for, can here be glanced at only
in the barest outline. There were Jews in England before
the Norman Conquest; but the first great influx came
in the reign of Rufus, whose financial genius recognized
in them an instrument for his gain, and who would the
more gladly protect them, as likely to prove a thorn in
the side of his enemy the Church. A second influx resulted
from the persecution of Israelites on the Continent
of Europe, consequent on the failure of the first Crusade.
This new alien immigration seems to have excited mistrust
in England, and led to the disarming of all Jews in 1181,
a measure which left them at the mercy of the Christian
rabble.</p>

<p class='c001'>Accordingly, when a disturbance occurred at the coronation
of Richard I., on 3rd September, 1189, owing to the
imprudence of some officious Jews, a general massacre took
place in London, while York and other towns were not
slow to follow the example. The king was moved to
anger, not so much by the sufferings of the Jews, as by
the destruction of their bonds, since that indirectly injured
the Crown; for the more the Jews had, the more could
be extorted from them, and when the written bond had
been burned, no evidence of the debt remained. Richard,
returning from his captivity a few years later, in urgent
need of money, determined to prevent a repetition of such
interference with a valuable source of revenue. His motive
was selfish, but that was no reason why the Israelites
should not pay for a measure designed for their own protection.
Assembled at Nottingham they granted a liberal
aid, in return for a new expedient devised to secure their
bonds. This scheme, for the details of which Richard was
probably indebted to the genius of his great justiciar, archbishop
Hubert Walter, was of a comprehensive and practical
character. In London, York, and other important
cities, offices or bureaus were established under the Crown’s
protection, containing treasure chests, called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>archae</i></span>, fitted
with triple locks, to be opened only at stated intervals in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>the presence of special custodians, known as chirographers,
who kept the keys. These custodians were usually four
in number, two Christians and two Jews, chosen by juries
specially summoned for that purpose by the sheriff of the
county, and they were obliged to find sureties that they
would faithfully perform their important functions. Only
in their presence could loans be validly contracted between
Jews and Christians; and it was their duty to see the terms
of all such bargains reduced to writing in a regular prescribed
form in duplicate copies. No contract was binding
unless a written copy or chirograph had been preserved in
one or other of those repositories or arks, which thus
served every purpose of a modern register, and other
purposes as well. If the money-lender suffered violence
and was robbed of his copy of the bond, the debtor was
still held to his obligations by the duplicate which remained.
If the Jew and all his relatives were slain, even then the
debtor did not escape, but was confronted by a new and
more powerful creditor, the king himself, armed with the
chirograph. Lists of all transactions were preserved, and
all acquittances and assignments of debts, known from
their Hebrew name as “starrs,” had also to be carefully
enrolled.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c017'><sup>[450]</sup></a> Minute and stringent rules, codified by Hubert
Walter in the terms of a written commission, were issued
to the judges when starting on their circuit in September,
1194.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c017'><sup>[451]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If this cunningly-devised system prevented the Christian
debtor from evading his obligations, it also placed the
Jewish creditor completely at the mercy of the Crown;
for the exact wealth of every Jew could be accurately
ascertained from a scrutiny of the contents of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>archae</i></span>.
The king’s officials were enabled to judge to a penny how
much it was possible to wring from the coffers of the Jews,
whose bonds, moreover, could be conveniently attached until
they paid the tallage demanded. The custom of fixing on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>royal castles as the places for keeping these arks, probably
explains the origin of the special jurisdiction exercised over
the Jews by the king’s constables (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>qui turres nostras
custodierunt</i></span>”).<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c017'><sup>[452]</sup></a> In the dungeons of their strongholds
horrible engines were at hand for enforcing obedience to
their awards. Such jurisdiction, however, extended legitimately
over trivial debts only.<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c017'><sup>[453]</sup></a> All important pleas were
reserved for the officials of the exchequer of the Jews,
a special government department, which controlled and
regulated the whole procedure. Evidences of the existence
of this separate exchequer have been traced back to
1198, although no record has been found of a date prior
to 1218.<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c017'><sup>[454]</sup></a> John, while despising the Jews, was not slow to
realize that in them the Crown possessed an asset of great
value. It was his policy to protect their wealth as a
reservoir from which he might draw in time of need,
contenting himself meanwhile with comparatively moderate
sums. Thus, by a charter dated 10th April, 1201, he
took 4000 marks in return for confirming their privileges;
and he obtained a second payment of a similar
amount after his rupture with Rome. The charter of
1201 was only a confirmation of rights already enjoyed
by all English Jews in virtue of the liberal interpretation
put upon the terms of an earlier charter which had been
granted by Henry I. to a particular father in Israel with
his household, but subsequently extended, with the tacit
concurrence of the Crown, to the whole Hebrew race.
Under John’s charter they enjoyed valuable and definite
privileges, which, while leaving them completely in the
royal power, exempted them from all jurisdictions except
those of the king and his castellans; while, if a Christian
brought a complaint against a Jew, it was to be judged
by the peers of that Jew.<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c017'><sup>[455]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>When a repetition of the massacre which had disgraced
his brother’s coronation threatened to take place in 1203,
John promptly ordered the mayor and barons of London
to suppress all such attempts. In terms contemptuous
alike to the Londoners and to the Jews his writ declared
that his promise of protection, “even though granted
to a dog,” must be held inviolate.<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c017'><sup>[456]</sup></a> Protection was
accorded to them, however, only that they might furnish
a richer booty to the Crown, when the proper occasion
arrived. Suddenly John issued orders for a wholesale arrest
of the Jews throughout England. The most wealthy
members of their community were brought together at
Bristol, and, on 1st November, 1210, were compelled to
give a reluctant consent to a general tallage at the
enormous sum of 66,000 marks. Apparently this amount
had been fixed as the result of an exaggerated estimate
of the contents of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>archae</i></span>, and was more than they
could afford to pay. The methods adopted by John’s
castellans to extort the arrears of the amount are well-known,
especially in the case of the unfortunate Jew of
Bristol, from whom seven teeth were extracted, one each
day, until he consented to pay the sum demanded.<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c017'><sup>[457]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was doubly hard that the race thus plundered and
tortured by the king should be subjected to harsh treatment
by the king’s enemies on the ground that they were
pampered protégés of the Crown. Yet such was the case:
on Sunday, 17th May, 1215, when the insurgents on their
way to Runnymede entered London, they robbed and
murdered the Jews, using the stones of their houses to
fortify the city walls.<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c017'><sup>[458]</sup></a> It is not to be wondered then that
the same insurgents in forcing on King John the demands
which formed the basis of Magna Carta, included provisions
against usury.</p>

<p class='c001'>The advisers of the young Henry in 1216 omitted these
clauses, but not from love of the Jews. They were unwilling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>to impair so useful a financial resource, which has been
compared to a sponge which slowly absorbed the wealth of
the nation to be quickly squeezed dry again by the king.
The Jews were always willing to disgorge a portion of
their gains in return for protection in the rest, even of a
contemptuous and intermittent kind; but their lot became
hard indeed when Henry III., urged by popular clamour
and the wishes of the Pope, began a course of active
persecution, without relaxing the rigour of those royal
exactions which had previously been the price of protection.
In 1253, a severe ordinance inflicted a long list of vexatious
regulations on the Hebrews, almost converting their quarters
in each great city into ghettos, like those of the Continent
of Europe. This was merely the commencement of a
series of oppressive measures, the natural outcome of the
growing hatred with which Christians regarded Jews,—a
result partly of the heated imagination of the rabble, ready
to believe unauthenticated stories of the crucifixion of
Christian children, and partly of the fact that rich Jews, in
spite of all persecution, had possessed themselves of the
landed estates of freeholders and nobles and claimed to
act as lords of Christian tenants, enjoying wardships,
escheats, and advowsons, as any Christian baron might have
done. The scope of this enquiry excludes any detailed
account of the stages through which repressive legislation
passed, until the lot of the Jews in England became
intolerable. The Statute of Jewry, however,<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c017'><sup>[459]</sup></a> was of exceptional
importance; taking from usurers the right to recover
interest by legal process, and limiting execution for the
principal to one half of the debtor’s lands and chattels.
In return some temporary concessions were granted. One
by one, all these privileges were withdrawn, until the end
came in 1290 with the issue of a decree of perpetual
banishment by Edward I., who was compelled to sacrifice
the cherished right of keeping a royal preserve of Jews in
deference to the culmination of national prejudice in a
storm of unreasoning hate.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>II. <i>Legal Position of the Jews.</i> All through these
vicissitudes of fortune the legal status of the Jews had
remained unchanged in all essentials. Their position was
doubly hard; they were plundered by the Crown and
persecuted by the populace. If John saved them from
being robbed by his Christian subjects, it was that they
might be better worth the robbing by a Christian
king. Yet, for this protection, at once fitful and
interested, the Jews had to pay a heavy price; not only
were they liable to be tallaged arbitrarily at the king’s will,
without limit and without appeal, but they were hated by
rich and poor as the king’s allies. Such feelings would
of themselves account for the unsympathetic treatment
accorded to money-lenders by Magna Carta; two other
reasons contributed. All usury was looked on in the
Middle Ages as immoral (although illegal only for Christians),
while excessive interest was habitually exacted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The feudal scheme of society had no place for Jews and
afforded them no protection. Not only did they share
the disabilities common to all aliens, but these were not in
their case mitigated by the protection extended to other
foreigners by their own sovereigns and by the Church.
As exiles in a foreign land, exposed to the attacks of a
hostile mob, they were forced to rely absolutely on the
only power strong enough to protect them, the arm of the
king. The Jews became the mere serfs, the perquisites or
chattels of the Crown, in much the same way as the villeins
became the serfs or chattels of their lords. Rights they
might have against others by royal sufferance, but they had
no legal remedy against their master. In the words of
Bracton,<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c017'><sup>[460]</sup></a> “the Jew could have nothing of his own, for
whatever he acquired, he acquired not for himself but
for the king.” His property was his merely by royal
courtesy, not under protection of the law. When he
died, his relations had no legal title to succeed to his
mortgages, goods, or money; the exchequer, fortified by
an intimate knowledge of the extent of his wealth (for that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>consisted chiefly in registered bonds), stepped into possession
and could do what it pleased. The king usually, indeed, in
practice contented himself with one-third of the whole; but
if the relations of the deceased Jew received less than the
balance of two-thirds, they would be well advised to offer no
remonstrance. The Crown did not admit a legal obligation;
and there was no one either powerful enough, or interested
enough, to compel the fulfilment of the tacit understanding
which restricted the royal claims. Whatever the Jew had
amassed belonged legally and potentially not to him but to
the Crown. Magna Carta, in striking at money-lenders, was
striking at the king.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a famous clause, greatly valued at the time it was
framed because of its precise terms and narrow scope (which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>made evasion difficult), and even more highly valued in
after days for exactly opposite reasons. It came indeed to
be interpreted in a broad general sense by enthusiasts who,
with the fully-developed British constitution before them,
read the clause as enunciating the modern doctrine that
the Crown can impose no financial burden whatsoever
on the people without consent of Parliament. Before
discussing how far such an estimate is justified, it will
be necessary to examine the historical context, with
special reference to two classes of John’s subjects;
his feudal tenants, and the citizens of London respectively.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Protection of Crown Tenants from arbitrary Exactions.</i>
The pecuniary obligations of the barons may be arranged in
two groups according as they depended on the king’s own
actions, or were determined by circumstances which lay
beyond the royal control. Payments of the former type
(such as reliefs and amercements), exigible only at fixed
dates or on the occurrence of specific events, were treated
of elsewhere in Magna Carta. The present chapter sought
to prevent John from extorting additional payments either
absolutely at his own discretion, or because of situations
which he had purposely created as excuses for demanding
money. The entire field of such arbitrary feudal dues was
covered by the words “scutages” and “extraordinary aids,”<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c017'><sup>[461]</sup></a>
the use of which protected the barons from every sort of
compulsory payment which might be demanded by the
king at his own discretion.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>Scutage.</i> The development of the system described
by this name has been traced in the Historical Introduction.<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c017'><sup>[462]</sup></a>
Used at first as an expedient for substituting,
in the Crown’s option, money payments for military service,
it became, under John, a regular source of revenue, imposed
almost every year on one pretext or another, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>it was levied at an increased rate, and under conditions of
a vexatious and burdensome nature. If any one cause
contributed, more than the others, to the rebellion which
culminated at Runnymede, it was John’s method of imposing
scutages. This chapter, then, attempted to strike at
the common root from which many grievances grew. The
Crown was no longer to be left sole judge of the occasions on
which a scutage might be demanded. “The common consent
(or counsel) of the realm” must first be obtained. If
this provision had been carried into practice, it would
have removed the supreme control of the system of scutages
from the Crown which received the money, to the Crown
tenants who paid it. This truly radical remedy included
the remedy of all minor abuses as well, since the collective
body of barons who could refuse payment unconditionally,
might <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a fortiori</i></span> make grants under such conditions as they
chose. Henceforward it would lie with them to say, on
each occasion, whether the old normal 20s. per knight’s
fee should be superseded by some other rate, either higher
or lower. This provision was never enforced, being
omitted altogether from the reissue of 1216, while the
clause substituted for it in the Charter of 1217 took
an entirely different form.<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c017'><sup>[463]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>Feudal aids.</i> It was recognized from an early
date that in emergencies feudal vassals ought to contribute
to their lord’s support in proportion to the extent
of their holdings. Such payments were known as aids,
and were originally supposed to be free-will offerings.<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c017'><sup>[464]</sup></a> By
John’s reign they had fallen into two groups—ordinary and
extraordinary. The former, three in number, were only
dealt with incidentally by the Charter.<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c017'><sup>[465]</sup></a> It is with the
“extraordinary” aids that this chapter specially occupies
itself. These are placed in the same position as scutages:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>the Crown cannot exact either, “unless by common
counsel of the realm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Protection of Citizens of London from arbitrary
Exactions.</i> Some attempt was made to protect the men
of London, as well as the Crown tenants, from John’s
demands for money. The insurgent leaders in this way
discharged part of their debt to an ally with special
claims upon their gratitude.<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c017'><sup>[466]</sup></a> The Articles of the Barons
had contained several important provisions affecting the
capital; and these were embodied in the Charter in
slightly altered terms, which suggest some influence at
work not altogether friendly to the citizens.<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c017'><sup>[467]</sup></a> The present
clause of the completed charter, for example, uses
only one word, “<em>aids</em>,” where the 32nd of the Articles
of the Barons had referred to “tallages and aids.”
There is no evidence to show whether the omission
had been deliberately planned, or was merely the result
of inadvertence; and the ambiguity inherent in both
words makes it dangerous to hazard a dogmatic opinion
on the practical effect of the alteration. Yet a clearly-marked
line can be traced between the respective meanings
of the two terms when they are technically used.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) “<em>Aid</em>” is the vaguer word, applicable to every
payment which can be regarded as in any sense a free-will
offering. It embraced gifts to the Crown, whether
from prelate or burgess or feudal baron. London was
stimulated towards acts of generosity by kings of England
both before and after John. There were times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>when “voluntary” aids, like the “benevolences” of
Tudor days, could not safely be withheld.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) “<em>Tallage</em>” was a tax levied at a feudal lord’s
arbitrary will upon more or less servile dependants, who
had neither power nor right to refuse. The frequency
of these exactions and the sums taken depended solely
on the lord’s caprice, restrained by no law, but only by
such limits as an enlightened self-interest or regard for
public opinion might dictate. Liability to arbitrary tallage
was thus one of the chief marks of an unfree
status, and was contrasted with the impositions levied
on those freeholders who held by knight’s service, by
socage, or by frankalmoin. The owner of the smallest
manor, like the owner of the greatest barony, might tallage
his own villeins; and the king had a similar privilege
over a wider field. His rights extended even over civic
communities who held royal charters, since towns were
theoretically on the royal demesne, and therefore liable
to tallage. The great city of London, in spite of its
growing wealth, its political importance, and its list of
chartered privileges, still shared this liability.<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c017'><sup>[468]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <i>Comparison of tallage and aid.</i> The tallage, as a
forced payment, thus differed fundamentally from the
nominally free “aid,” while two minor points of
difference may also be noted. In arranging an aid the
givers usually suggested the amount, though the king
might reject the offer as insufficient; while the amount
of a tallage, on the other hand, was arbitrarily fixed by
the Crown. Further, while the aid granted by a community
was a joint offering which the citizens assessed
and collected by their own officers, and for which they
admitted a collective responsibility, the Crown itself
allocated on whom it pleased the particular sums of
tallage to be paid by each individual, no joint liability
being admitted by those who had to pay. It was obviously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>to the advantage of a borough to forestall, by the
present of a liberal aid, the Crown’s anticipated demand
for a tallage, for the hated tax-gatherer was thus kept
outside the city gates. An aid was also more to the
king’s advantage than a tallage of equal amount. Not
only was he saved the trouble, expense, and delay
of the collection, but he obviated risk of loss
through the insolvency of some of the individuals fixed
upon.</p>

<p class='c001'>A story told by Madox<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c017'><sup>[469]</sup></a> brings out the contrast. A
dispute had arisen between the king and the Londoners.
To Henry’s demand for 3000 marks of “tallage” they
at first replied by offering 2000 marks of “aid,” which
the king refused. The citizens then denied liability to
tallage altogether, but were confronted with entries in
Exchequer and Chancery Rolls which entirely contradicted
their audacious contention. On the morrow the
mayor and citizens acknowledged that they were talliable,
and gave the king the sum he demanded.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <i>Effects of the omission of the word “tallage” from
Magna Carta.</i> As the two words appearing in the Articles
of the Barons had well-recognized differences of meaning,
it is unlikely that the omission of one of them from the
Charter was regarded as a purely verbal change. John
would readily enough dispense with the right to exact
“aids” from the wealthy traders of his capital, if he still
preserved his privilege of tallaging them at pleasure. The
omission was perhaps deliberately made in deference to
John’s strong feeling on a point which did not personally
affect the barons.<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c017'><sup>[470]</sup></a> Another omission should be noted. The
Articles had extended protection not only to Londoners,
but also “to citizens of other places who thence have their
liberties,” meaning the towns whose chartered privileges
had been modelled on those of the metropolis. Magna
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Carta completely ignored, in this connection, all towns
except London.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c017'><sup>[471]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(5) <i>The nature of the protection afforded by Magna Carta.</i>
The arrangement of the present chapter is peculiar. After
treating fully of the abuses of Crown tenants, the case
of the Londoners is thrown in carelessly in a few words:
“In like manner it shall be done concerning aids from
the citizens of London.” Various interpretations of the
words “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>simili modo</i></span>” are possible. High authorities suggest
that the clause means no more than that aids taken
from London, like ordinary aids taken from Crown tenants,
must be “reasonable.”<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c017'><sup>[472]</sup></a> If this is so, a criterion of
reasonableness different from that applicable to knights’
fees became necessary; and this would have been hard
to find.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c017'><sup>[473]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is equally probable, however, that the intention was
to render the same consent necessary to the validity of
aids, asked from London, as had previously been stipulated
in the case of scutages from tenants in chief. If this is
so, then the method provided in chapter 14 for taking
“the common counsel of the realm” was peculiarly ill-adapted
to secure to the men of London any effective
voice in taxing themselves. The necessity for the consent
of an exclusively baronial assembly could not adequately
protect the Londoners, whose essentially different interests
were unrepresented.</p>

<p class='c001'>Subsequent history casts no light on the original intention
of this clause; no occasion of testing its meaning
ever occurred, the entire chapter of which it forms part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>having been omitted from all subsequent issues of the
Charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>(6) <i>Later history of the Crown’s right to tallage the towns.</i>
Magna Carta, even in its original form, did not deprive
the king of his right to tallage London, like any other
part of his ancient demesne; and the Crown continued
quite legally and almost without question to exercise this
prerogative at intervals from 1215 until 1340. It has
sometimes been maintained, indeed, that the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Confirmatio
Cartarum</cite></span> of 1297 was intended to abolish this prerogative,
and it is true, that a document once considered as an
authoritative version of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Confirmatio</cite></span> bore the suggestive
title of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De tallagio non concedendo</cite></span>. It is now well known
that the latter document is quite unauthentic; while, if
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>confirmatio</i></span> itself was intended to relieve the towns
from tallages taken without their consent, it signally failed.
Edward III. occasionally exacted tallages from London
and other towns. His parliaments, however, sought to
prohibit this, and succeeded, in 1340, in passing a statute
which abolished, in words peculiarly wide and categorical,
unparliamentary taxation of every kind whatsoever. This
act, which is sometimes styled by modern writers “the
real <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>statutum de tallagio non concedendo</i></span>,” is held by Dr.
Stubbs to have conclusively abolished <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inter alia</i></span> the
Crown’s right of tallage.<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c017'><sup>[474]</sup></a> This finally settled the law,
but did not prevent the king from trying to break that
law. In subsequent years Edward III. frequently disregarded
the restriction thus placed upon his financial
resources, and with varying success. He rarely did so,
however, without meeting protests; and the rule of law
laid down in the act of 1340 was never repealed.</p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>Magna Carta and the Theory of Parliamentary
Taxation.</i> It is a commonplace of our text-books that
chapters 12 and 14 taken together amount to the Crown’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>absolute surrender of all powers of arbitrary taxation, and
even that they enunciate a general doctrine of the nation’s
right to tax itself.<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c017'><sup>[475]</sup></a> Yet the very idea of “taxation” in
its abstract form, as opposed to specific tolls and tallages
levied on definite things or individuals, is essentially
modern. The doctrine of the day was that the king in
normal times ought “to live of his own,” like any other
land-owning gentleman. A regular scheme of “taxation”
to meet the ordinary expenses of government was
undreamt of. It is too much to suppose, then, that our
ancestors in 1215 sought to abolish something which,
strictly speaking, did not exist. The famous clause treats,
not of “taxation” in the abstract, but of the scutages
and aids already discussed. It does not concern itself
with the rights of Englishmen as such, but chiefly with
the interests of those who held freeholds of the Crown,
and incidentally and inadequately with those of the citizens
of London. Several considerations place this beyond
reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) The terms of the restriction are by no means wide
or sweeping; but precise, accurate, and narrow. The
“common consent of the realm” was made a requisite
for three species of exactions at the most: for scutages
and for extraordinary aids taken from the feudal tenants,
and possibly also for aids taken from the city of London:
that is all. Not a word is said of any other form of
taxation or of other groups of taxpayers. The restriction
thus benefits Crown tenants only, with the doubtful addition
of the Londoners. (2) If under-tenants received by chapter
15 some protection against their mesne lords, they received
none against the claims of the king. The Charter affected
not national “taxation,” but merely feudal dues. (3) The
scant measure of protection afforded did not extend even
to all Crown tenants. The king’s villeins were, of course,
excluded; and so were even freeholders whose tenure was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>other than that of chivalry. Socage tenants were left
liable to carucage and other exactions, tenants in frankalmoin
(among them the wealthy Cistercian monks) to forced
contributions from the wool and hides of their sheep, while
the right of the Crown arbitrarily to raise the “farms”
of all parts of its own demesnes was deliberately reserved.<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c017'><sup>[476]</sup></a>
(4) The Crown’s initiative in “taxation” (here restricted
in regard to “aids” and “scutages”) was, under many
other names and forms, left intact. The king required no
consent before taking such prizes and custom dues as he
thought fit from merchandise reaching or leaving England,
or before taking tolls and fines at inland markets under
the plea of regulating trade. Tallages also were exigible
at discretion from aliens and Jews, from tenants of demesne,
from London and other chartered towns. (5) The limited
scope of this restriction on prerogative is further illustrated
by the method provided for taking “the common consent.”
The assembly to be convened for that purpose was a
narrow body, representative neither of the several ranks
and classes of the community, nor of the separate national
interests, nor yet of the various districts of England. On
the contrary, its composition was extremely homogeneous,
an aristocratic council of the military tenants of the Crown,
convened in such a way that only the greater among
them were likely to attend.<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c017'><sup>[477]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These facts serve as a warning not to read into Magna
Carta modern conceptions which its own words will not
warrant. This famous clause was far from formulating
any national doctrine of self-taxation; it was primarily
intended to protect Crown tenants from impositions levied
by John, not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>qua</i></span> sovereign but <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>qua</i></span> feudal lord. Such
as it was, it was totally omitted, along with its corollary
(chapter 14), in 1216. The provision substituted for
both, in the Charter of 1217, referred only to scutages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>saying nothing about aids, and cannot possibly be read as
a general prohibition of all arbitrary taxation by the
Crown.<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c017'><sup>[478]</sup></a></p>

liberties and free customs, as well by land as by water;
furthermore, we decree and grant that all other cities,

free customs.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>A full list of the liberties and customs of London would
be a long one; and an account of how each of these grew
up and was confirmed by the Crown need not be given here.
The most cherished of the privileges enjoyed in John’s day
were the right to appoint a civic chief, who bore the name
of mayor, and the right to choose sheriffs of their own
who should collect the city’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma</i></span><a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c017'><sup>[479]</sup></a> (or annual rent payable
to the exchequer), so as to obviate the intrusion of royal
bailiffs. Only a brief account of the way in which the
metropolis obtained these two privileges need be here
attempted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The chief feature of London before the Norman Conquest
seems to have been lack of proper municipal organisation.
Dr. Stubbs describes the capital during the eleventh century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>as “a bundle of communities, townships, parishes, and lordships,
of which each has its own constitution.”<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c017'><sup>[480]</sup></a> It was
thus a collection of small administrative units, rather than
one large unit. Some semblance of legal unity was, it
is true, afforded by the folkmoot, in which the citizens
regularly assembled; by its smaller council known as
“husteng”; and perhaps also by its “cnihtengild” (if,
indeed, this third body be not entirely mythical); while
the existence of a “portreeve” shows that for some
financial purposes also the city was treated as one whole.
London, however, prior to the reign of Henry I. was far
from possessing machinery adequate to the duties of a
local government for the whole community.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first step towards acquiring a municipal constitution
is generally supposed to have been taken by the citizens
when they obtained a charter from Henry I. in the last
years of his reign (1130-35). This is not strictly accurate.
London, indeed, by that grant gained certain valuable
privileges and enjoyed them for a short time, but it did
not obtain a constitution. The chief rights actually conferred
by Henry were as follows:—(1) The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma</i></span> was fixed
at the reduced rate of £300 per annum, the citizens obtaining
for this payment a lease in perpetuity of their own
city with the surrounding county of Middlesex—the grant
being made to the citizens and their heirs; (2) they acquired
the right to appoint whom they pleased as sheriffs of London
and Middlesex, implying the exclusion of the king’s tax-collectors
by men of their own choosing; (3) a similar right
of appointing their own nominee as justiciar was also conferred
on them, to the exclusion apparently of the royal
justices of eyre. Many minor privileges were confirmed
which need not here be specified. Mr. J. H. Round<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c017'><sup>[481]</sup></a> argues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>with convincing force that these concessions, important as
they were, did not confer a civic constitution upon London.
Henry’s charter, in his opinion, confirmed all the already
existing separate jurisdictions and franchises, perpetuating
the old state of disunion, rather than creating a new
principle of cohesion. He proves, further, that these
benefits continued in force only for a few years after
Stephen’s accession. That king was coerced by the Earl of
Essex into infringing the citizens’ chartered rights; and
London did not regain the ground thus lost until the reign
of Richard I.</p>

<p class='c001'>Henry II., indeed, granted a charter to the citizens in
1155, which is usually interpreted as a full confirmation of
all the concessions of the earlier Henry.<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c017'><sup>[482]</sup></a> Mr. Round has
conclusively proved the error of this opinion.<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c017'><sup>[483]</sup></a> The charter
of 1155 restricted, rather than enlarged, the privileges
of London, being couched in cautious and somewhat grudging
terms. The main concessions of the earlier charter were
completely omitted: the citizens no longer elected their own
sheriffs or their own justiciar; the reduction of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma</i></span> to
£300 was not confirmed; and subsequent pipe rolls show
that Henry doubled that amount, although the Londoners
protested, arguing for the lower rate.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next crisis came early in Richard’s reign. Then it
was that London first obtained its municipal constitution.
Then also it regained and secured on a permanent basis the
privileges precariously held for a few years under Henry I.
and Stephen. The form in which the constitution came
at last was borrowed from France, and was neither more
nor less than the <i>Commune</i>, so well known on the Continent
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The commune
of London was possibly modelled upon the commune of
Rouen; the chief cities of England and Normandy respectively
must have had intimate relations. Mr. Round<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c017'><sup>[484]</sup></a> has shown
that these concessions were not, as has sometimes been supposed,
voluntarily granted in 1189 by Richard I., but were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>extorted from his younger brother John, when that ambitious
prince was bidding high for powerful allies to
support his claim to act as Regent. London really got
its first constitution on 8th October, 1191, under picturesque
and memorable circumstances. While Richard
tarried in the Holy Land, a scramble took place at home
for the right to represent him. The Chancellor Longchamp
had been appointed Regent; but John, wily and unscrupulous,
successfully ousted him, with the help of the men
of London. At the critical moment the metropolis had
offered its support on conditions, which included the restoration
of all the short-lived privileges conferred by the
charter of Henry I., and, in addition, a municipal constitution
of its own in the form of a commune of the
continental type.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Round, in a notable passage, describes the scene.
"When, in the crisis of October, 1191, the administration
found itself paralysed by the conflict between John, as the
king’s brother, and Longchamp, as the king’s representative,
London, finding that she held the scales, promptly named
the 'Commune’ as the price of her support. The chronicles
of the day enable us to picture to ourselves the scene, as
the excited citizens, who had poured forth overnight, with
lanterns and torches to welcome John to the capital,
streamed together on the morning of the eventful 8th
October at the well-known sound of the great bell, swinging
out from its campanile in St. Paul’s Churchyard. There
they heard John take the oath to the ‘Commune,’ like a
French king or lord; and then London, for the first time,
had a municipality of her own."<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c017'><sup>[485]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>For any accurate definition of a commune we look in
vain to contemporary writers, who are usually carried away
by their political bias. Richard of Devizes<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c017'><sup>[486]</sup></a> quotes with
approval, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Communia est tumor plebis, timor regni, tepor
sacerdotii</i></span>.” Some insight has been gained in recent years,
however, into its exact nature. A Commune was a town
which had obtained recognition as a corporate entity, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>a link in the feudal chain, becoming the free vassal of
the king or other lord, and itself capable of having sub-vassals
of its own.<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c017'><sup>[487]</sup></a> Its chief institutions were a
mayor and an elective council, generally composed of
twenty-four members, some or all of whom were known as
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>échevins</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>skivini</i></span>, a word which in its modern form of
“scavengers” has fallen on evil days, no longer denoting
the city fathers, but men who perform civic duties of a
useful but less dignified nature. Perhaps the chief peculiarity
of the commune was the method of its formation,
namely, by popular association or conspiracy, involving the
taking of an oath of a more or less revolutionary nature by
the citizens and its subsequent ratification by those in
authority. It is generally admitted that these communes,
though revolutionary in their origin, were not necessarily
democratic in their sympathies. Under the new constitution
of London, the grievous taxation of Richard’s reign was
made to fall more heavily on the poor of London than on
any other class. The commune thus set up in 1191,
tolerated at first rather than encouraged by the Crown,
formed thenceforth the municipal government of the capital;
the citizens chose not only their own sheriffs, but also their
own mayor, although the latter, when once appointed, held
office for life.</p>

<p class='c001'>When John became king, he granted three charters,
ratifying the privileges of the capital in return for a
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gersuma</i></span> (or slump payment) of 3000 marks.<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c017'><sup>[488]</sup></a> All the
franchises specified in the old charter of Henry I. were
now confirmed, with one exception: the liberty to appoint
a justiciar of their own, now seen to be inconsistent with
the Crown’s centralizing policy, was abandoned. None of
these charters made mention of mayor or commune, but they
confirmed some minor privileges gained in Richard’s reign.<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c017'><sup>[489]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>A fourth charter, dated 20th March, 1201, was merely
of temporary interest; but a fifth, granted on 9th May,
1215, little more than a month previous to Magna Carta,
is of great importance, and represents the bait thrown
by John to the citizens in the hope of gaining their
support in this new crisis, as he had previously gained it in
the crisis of 1191. The fifth charter not merely confirmed
to the citizens in explicit terms the right already
enjoyed by them of electing a mayor for life, but allowed
them to elect a new one every year. Miss Norgate does
not exaggerate, when she describes this concession as “the
crowning privilege of a fully constituted municipality, the
right to elect their own mayor every year.”<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c017'><sup>[490]</sup></a> An annually
elected magistrate would, undoubtedly, feel his
dependence on the citizens more than one holding office
for life; but it seems probable that the chief value
of the grant lay in its confirmation by John as king, of
the rights conceded by him fourteen years earlier as his
brother’s unauthorised representative, and enjoyed meanwhile
on an insecure tenure. The charter of May, 1215,
by officially recognizing the mayor, placed the commune
over which he presided on a legal footing. The revolutionary
civic constitution, sworn to in 1191 was now
confirmed. The citizens acted on the permission granted
them of annually changing their chief magistrate: but in
place of supporting the king who made the grant, they
opened their gates to his enemies.<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c017'><sup>[491]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such then was the London whose privileges were confirmed
by Magna Carta—a city which had slowly grown to
greatness, obtaining after many struggles a complete
municipal constitution in the form of a commune with
annually elected mayor and council, as well as sheriffs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>its own appointment, who excluded the Crown’s financial
officers not only from the district within its walls but
from the whole of Middlesex. The Great Charter, avoiding
details, confined itself to a general confirmation to the
men of London of their ancient “liberties and free customs,”
two words<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c017'><sup>[492]</sup></a> whose vagueness ought in this connection to
receive a liberal interpretation.<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c017'><sup>[493]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>London, in this respect, was not to stand alone; a similar
concession was explicitly made in favour of all other cities,
boroughs, towns, and sea-ports. This was a mere confirmation,
however, not to be read as conferring new privileges
or exemptions, each borough being left to prove its own
customs as best it might. In the reissues of Henry, the
distinction of being mentioned by name was shared by these
“barons of London,” with “the barons of the Cinque ports,”
who from their wealth, their situation, and their fleet, were
allies well worth conciliating. They played, indeed, a
prominent part in the decisive naval victory gained by
Hubert de Burgh on 24th August, 1217.<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c017'><sup>[494]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Other portions of John’s Great Charter which specially
affected the Londoners were the last clause of chapter 12,
and chapters 33 and 41; while many of the privileges
granted or confirmed in other chapters were shared by
them. The Mayor of London, it should be added, was one
of the executive committee of twenty-five, entrusted with
wide powers to enforce the provisions of the Charter.<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c017'><sup>[495]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the most cherished privileges claimed by the
chartered boroughs were the rights to exact tolls and to
place oppressive restrictions upon all rival traders not
members of their guilds, foreigners and denizens alike. The
confirmation of these privileges in this chapter has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>held to contradict chapter 41, which grants protection and
immunities to foreign merchants.<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c017'><sup>[496]</sup></a> The inconsistency, however,
should not be pushed too far, since the later chapter
aimed at the abolition of “evil customs” inflicted by the
king, not of those inflicted by the boroughs. At the same
time, all favour shown to aliens would be bitterly resented
by their rivals, the English traders. If the charter had
been put in force in its integrity, the more specific
privileges in favour of foreign merchants would have prevailed
in opposition to the vague confirmation of borough
“liberties” wherever the two came into collision.<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c017'><sup>[497]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This chapter, which has no equivalent among the Articles
of the Barons, appears here incidentally: it would never
have found a place in Magna Carta but for the need of
suitable machinery to give effect to the provision of chapter
12.<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c017'><sup>[498]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As the earlier clause is frequently supposed to contain a
general doctrine of <em>taxation</em>, so this one is often cited as
enunciating a general doctrine of <em>parliamentary representation</em>;
while the close connection between the two chapters is taken
to indicate an equally close connection between the two
conceptions supposed to underlie them, and is urged as
evidence that the framers of Magna Carta had grasped the
essentially modern principle that taxation and representation
go together.<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c017'><sup>[499]</sup></a> In this view, the barons at Runnymede
deserve credit for anticipating some of the best features
of the modern system of parliamentary government. The
words of the text, however, will scarcely bear so liberal
an interpretation. Vital points of difference between the
principles of Magna Carta and the modern doctrine of
representation are revealed by a careful analysis.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under chapter 12 scutages and extraordinary aids could
only be levied “with common counsel of our kingdom,” and
now chapter 14, by formulating rules for convening the
individuals whose consent was thus required, fixes authoritatively
the composition of an assembly definitely charged
with this specific function. The same Latin words which
signify joint “consent” or counsel thus came to signify also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>a special institution, namely, that “Common Council” afterwards
of such vital constitutional importance, continuing
under a new name the old <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>curia regis</i></span> in several of its most
important aspects, and passing in turn into the modern
Parliament. The duties and constitutional importance of
this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commune concilium</i></span> may be considered under six heads.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Nature of the Summons.</i> Formal writs had to be
issued when the attendance of the members was required.
These writs must specify the time, place, and reason of
assembling, giving formal notice at least forty days in advance.
In these respects the writs issued were all to be the same;
but in one vital particular a distinction was recognized.
Each of the really powerful men of the realm—archbishops,
bishops, abbots, earls, and "other greater barons"—must
receive a separate writ, under the royal seal, addressed to
him individually and directly, while the “smaller barons”
were to be summoned collectively and indirectly through
the sheriffs and bailiffs of each district.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Composition of the Council.</i> It is clear that the
meetings contemplated were purely baronial assemblies since
none but Crown tenants were invited to attend; while individual
notice under the king’s seal was given only to the
more important magnates among them. The Common
Council of the Charter was thus an assembly of military
Crown tenants, and “the common consent of my kingdom”
in John’s mouth was synonymous with “the consent of my
barons.”<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c017'><sup>[500]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The king’s Council had by this time freed itself from any
complicated theories as to its own composition, which may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>ever have hampered it. It was now extremely homogeneous;
a feudal muster of Crown vassals. Some historians, indeed,
in their anxiety to find distinguished pedigrees for their
democratic ideals, have traced the origins of the leading
features of the modern Parliament back to the Anglo-Saxon
era; but such attempts are hurtful to the best
interests of history, while they do not in the least
advance the cause of popular liberties.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is unnecessary here to examine the various rival
theories professing to explain the composition of the Anglo-Saxon
Witenagemot, or to discuss the exact connection
between that venerable institution and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia Regis</i></span> of
the Norman kings. As a matter of fact, the early constitution
of the court of the Conqueror or of Rufus seems to
have been monarchic rather than aristocratic or democratic;
that is to say, it depended to a great extent on the personal
will of the king, who might issue or withhold writs of
summons very much as he pleased. No evidence exists, of
date anterior to the Great Charter, of any magnate thrusting
himself unbidden into a royal council or forcing the king to
issue a formal invitation. On one occasion, indeed, the action
of Henry II. in omitting to issue a writ laid him open to
unfavourable criticism. This was in October, 1164, when a
special council was summoned to Northampton to pass judgment
upon various questions at issue between the king and
Thomas à Becket. The primate was ordered to appear for
judgment, but the formal writ of summons, which every
archbishop, as holder of a barony, was wont to receive as
matter of course, was deliberately withheld. Apparently
contemporary opinion condemned this omission.<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c017'><sup>[501]</sup></a> It is safe
to infer, then, that as early as 1164, the method of issuing
these writs had become uniform, but this constitutional
understanding was not reduced to writing until embodied in
Magna Carta. Thus it was in 1215 that the magnates of
England formulated for the first time a distinct claim to be
present at the king’s councils; and even then the demand
only referred to assemblies summoned for one specific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>purpose. Previously, attendance was reckoned not as a
privilege, but merely as an expensive burden, incident, like
so many other burdens, to the possession of land.<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c017'><sup>[502]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>Position of the “Minor Barons.”</i> In recognizing a
distinction between two classes of Crown tenants, the Great
Charter merely gave the weight of its authority to existing
usage, as that had taken shape in the reign of Henry II.
Crown tenants varied in power and position in proportion
to the extent of their lands, from the great earl who owned
the larger share of one or more counties, down to the small
free-holder with only a few hides, or it might be acres, of
land. A rough division was drawn somewhere in the midst;
but the exact boundary was necessarily vague, and this
vagueness was probably encouraged by the Crown, whose
requirements might vary from time to time.<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c017'><sup>[503]</sup></a> Those Crown
tenants on one side of this fluctuating line were known
as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones majores</i></span>, those on the other as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones minores</i></span>. The
distinction had been recognized as early as the days of
Henry II.;<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c017'><sup>[504]</sup></a> but Magna Carta helped to stereotype it,
and contributed to the growing tendency to confine the
word “baron” to the greater men.<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c017'><sup>[505]</sup></a> It is unlikely
that any “minor baron” who obeyed the general
summons would enjoy equal authority with the magnates
invited individually by writ; and it is difficult to
say even whether he was sure of a welcome, and, if so,
in what capacity. Three distinct theories at least have
been advanced as to the position occupied by the “minor
barons” in the Common Council. (1) The duty of attendance,
burdensome to all, was specially burdensome to the
poorer Crown tenants. It has accordingly been suggested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>that the device of inviting them by general summons was
intended as an intimation that they need not come. This
is the view taken by Prof. Medley.<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c017'><sup>[506]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) Dr. Hannis Taylor holds an exactly opposite opinion,
reading this chapter as the outcome of a desire to ensure the
fuller attendance of the smaller men—as an attempt “to rouse
the lesser baronage to the exercise of rights which had practically
passed into desuetude.”<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c017'><sup>[507]</sup></a> Each of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones minores</i></span>
was thus encouraged to attend for himself and his own
interests. If such an attempt had really been made, and had
succeeded in compelling the attendance of a large proportion
of those who previously had almost made good their right to
shirk the burden, the result would have been to leave no
room whatever for the future introduction of the representative
principle into the national council.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) A third theory, while agreeing that those summoned
by general writ were intended to obey the summons, thinks
that the smaller Crown tenants were called not exclusively
each man for himself, but in a representative capacity. It is
thus suggested that a few knights (probably elected for this
purpose by their fellows) were expected to attend to represent
the others. Dr. Stubbs seems predisposed towards this
opinion, although he expresses himself with his usual caution.<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c017'><sup>[508]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The reasons for rejecting this third theory will be more
conveniently discussed in connection with the doctrine of
representation. It is perhaps unnecessary to decide between
the two others; but it may be suggested, even at the risk of
seeming to invent a fourth theory in a series already too
numerous, that to the great men who framed the clause it
must have been a matter of supreme indifference whether
their humbler fellow-tenants attended or stayed away. The
general summons expressed neither an urgent desire for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>presence, nor yet an intimation that they were not
wanted; but merely conformed with the established usage,
and left with each “minor baron” the decision whether he
should come or stay away. His presence would make little
difference upon the deliberations of the magnates.</p>

<p class='c001'>IV. <i>Representation.</i> It is well to hesitate before applying
to ancient institutions a word so essentially modern as “representation.”
In a sense the reeve and the four best men of
every village “represented” their fellows in the county court
from a very early age; and in a somewhat different sense
the feudal lord “represented” his free tenants and villeins
in the king’s court, but in neither instance was there anything
approaching the very definite relation which exists at
the present day between the elected member of Parliament
and the constituents he “represents.” It is true that the
difference may in some respects be one of degree rather than
of kind, and it is further true that two years before the date of
Magna Carta a tentative experiment had been tried in the
direction of introducing representatives of the counties into
the king’s Council, thus taking the first step in a long process
destined ultimately to lead without any absolute breach of continuity
to the modern Parliament. But the Barons in June,
1215, showed no desire to follow the example set by John in
November, 1213. The terms in which Magna Carta directs
that all minor barons should be summoned are explicit, and
may be profitably contrasted with the words used in the writ
dated 7th November, 1213, addressed to the sheriff of
Oxford, ordering him to compel, in addition to the barons
and the knights already summoned (presumably <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones
minores</i></span>), the attendance of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quatuor discretos homines de
comitatu tuo</i></span> (presumably other than Crown tenants).<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c017'><sup>[509]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>So far from the words of Magna Carta showing any desire
to confirm this precedent, they show a deliberate intention
to ignore it, and to fall back on the more ancient practice.
The members of the assembly which Magna Carta stipulated
should be convened for the taking of “the common consent”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>were all of one type, drawn from the same section of the
land-owning aristocracy, namely, military tenants-in-chief of
the Crown. The barons, great and small, might be present,
each man for himself; but the other tax-paying classes were
completely ignored.<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c017'><sup>[510]</sup></a> They were neither present nor yet
represented. The barons in this, as in other matters, stood
out for the old feudal order under which they had preserved
a wide measure of independence from the Crown’s control;
whereas King John for selfish reasons adopted the more
enlightened policy of his father, and even, unconsciously it
may be, anticipated some of the measures of his grandson,
Edward Plantagenet. In brief, John was progressive,
while his opponents were conservative. The present
chapter must be added to the not inconsiderable list
of those which attempted to bring about a feudal
reaction.<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c017'><sup>[511]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>V. <i>Powers and Functions of the Council.</i> It was not until
long after the days of Magna Carta that Parliament secured
the most important of those functions now deemed essential
to its existence. No claim was made by the Great Charter
on behalf of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commune concilium</i></span> to any right to be consulted
in the making of laws or in the performance of
administrative or judicial duties by the Crown. No effort
was made towards formulating any doctrine of ministerial
responsibility. This assembly, narrow and aristocratic in
its composition, had only one right secured to it by Magna
Carta—namely, a limited control over one form of taxation.
Even here, as we have seen, no general or sweeping claim
was put forward on its behalf. It had no right to a control
of the national purse: the barons confined themselves to a
selfish assertion of a right to protect their own individual
pockets against an increase of feudal burdens. A modern
Magna Carta would have contained a careful list of the
powers and privileges of “the common council of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>realm,” and would have given to this list a conspicuous
place of honour.<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c017'><sup>[512]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>VI. <i>Rights of Majorities and Minorities.</i> The medieval
conception of constitutional solidarity was defective; the
king’s council acted too much like a fortuitous gathering of
unrelated individuals, and too little like a recognized organ
of the body politic. Each “baron” was summoned on his
own behalf, and in order that he might give his individual
consent to a proposed levy; while it is doubtful how far a
dissenting minority could be bound by a decision of the
rest. Accordingly, the framers of Magna Carta deemed
it necessary to assert what would be too obvious to modern
politicians to require assertion—namely, that when the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commune concilium</i></span> had been properly convened, its power
to transact business should not be interfered with because a
section of those summoned chose to stay away. “The business
shall proceed on the day appointed, according to the
advice of such as shall be present, although all that were
summoned do not come.” Not all business was competent,
however, for the cause of summons had to be mentioned in
the writs. If these writs were in order, the Council, so we
may presume, had power to impose aids or scutages on
those who were absent.<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c017'><sup>[513]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing is said, however, as to the validity of a protest
made by those who came and expressed disapproval of what
the majority agreed to. As the substance of this chapter
was observed in practice (though omitted from subsequent
confirmations), a precedent of the year 1221 may perhaps
be cited to illustrate the interpretation put upon it by contemporary
practice. A Council summoned by William
Marshal, as Regent of Henry III., had consented to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>levy of scutage, and the bishop of Winchester was assessed
at 159 marks as the amount due for his knight’s fees. He
refused to pay, on the ground, quite untenable by modern
standards, that he had all along dissented from the grant.
The fact of his protest was vouched by Hubert de Burgh
and others who had been present at the Council. The plea
was actually accepted by the Regent, and the exchequer
adjudged bishop Peter to be quit of the payment.<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c017'><sup>[514]</sup></a>
The incident shows how far the statesmen of the day
were from realizing the most elementary principles of
political theory. They had not yet grasped the conception
of a Council endowed with constitutional authority
to impose its will on a dissenting minority. Here it
was apparently a minority of one.</p>

<p class='c001'>The barons by consenting in 1217 to accept a return
to the fixed rates of scutage customary in the reign of
Henry II., deliberately sacrificed such right of control
over the finances of the nation as they may have obtained
in 1215. At no time, indeed, did they show any appreciation
of the vital nature of the constitutional issues at stake.
The importance of the common council, and the necessity
of defining its composition, functions, and privileges, lay
entirely beyond their narrow sphere of vision.</p>

<p class='c001'>It should be remembered, however, that the substance
of this chapter of John’s charter (although discarded in
subsequent reissues) was virtually observed in practice
by the Crown, and treated as in force by the barons.
From this time forward the Common Council was almost
invariably consulted before the Crown attempted to levy
such contributions; and sometimes was bold enough to
make conditions or to decline payment altogether, the
first instance on record of an outright refusal taking
place in a Parliament held at London in January,
1242.<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c017'><sup>[515]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The barons, in October, 1255, if Matthew Paris has
not fallen into error, considered that the provisions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>chapters 12 and 14 of John’s Magna Carta were still
in force, although they had been omitted in the reissues
of Henry III. When the king asked a liberal aid in
furtherance of his scheme for securing the crown of
Sicily for his son Edmund, those present at the Council
deliberately refused, on the ground that some of their
peers had not been summoned “according to the tenor
of Magna Carta.” This incident illustrates the extreme
constitutional importance rightly attached by the barons
to the rigid observance by the Crown of the established
usage relative to the convening of Parliament.<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c017'><sup>[516]</sup></a></p>

however, had here to be adopted, since the expedient
relied on in chapter 12 (“the common consent of the
realm”) was clearly inapplicable.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Points of difference between tenants-in-chief and
under-tenants.</i> Tenants of mesne lords were in some
respects better off than tenants of the king,<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c017'><sup>[518]</sup></a> but in
others their position was distinctly worse. Not only
had they to satisfy the demands of their own lord for
“aids,” but they generally found that part of every
burden laid by the king upon that lord’s shoulders was
transferred to theirs. In seeking to provide for under-tenants
the protection of which they stood so much in
need Magna Carta looked, not to the common council,
but to the king. No mesne lord was to be allowed to
compel his tenants to contribute to his necessities without
obtaining a written licence from the Crown; and
stringent rules forbade the issue of such licences except
upon the usual three occasions. Contrast this procedure
with that which affected Crown tenants.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) While chapter 12 had spoken of “aids and
scutages,” this one speaks of “aids” alone. The omission
can be readily explained: a mesne lord in England
had no right of private war, and was, as a logical consequence,
debarred from demanding scutage upon his
own initiative. He might, indeed, allocate upon his
freeholders part of any scutage which the Crown had
taken from him; but the great barons who framed the
Charter had no intention to renounce so just a right.
The restriction of this clause to “aids” was thus intentional.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) It would have been absurd to require “the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>common counsel of the realm” to every aid paid by
the freeholders of a manor. The embryo Parliament
had no time for petty local affairs; and the present
chapter makes no such suggestion. Some substitute
had, however, to be found. A natural expedient would
have been to compel the mesne lord who wished an
aid to take “the common consent” of the freeholders of
his manor, assembled for that purpose in their court
baron, as in a local parliament. This course was sometimes
followed. Henry Tracey, for example, in 1235
(although armed with a royal writ), convened his Devonshire
knights and obtained their collective consent to an
aid of 20s. per fee on the occasion of his daughter’s
marriage.<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c017'><sup>[519]</sup></a> No such obligation, however, had been placed
upon mesne lords by Magna Carta, which had sought a
practical substitute for “the common consent of the
realm” in quite a different direction, as will be explained
immediately.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) A check upon such exactions was sought, not in any
action by the court baron, but in the mesne lord’s need for a
royal licence. The necessity for this may at first have
been a practical, rather than a legal, one; for executive
power lay with the officers of the Crown alone, and the
sheriff gave his services only at the king’s command.<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c017'><sup>[520]</sup></a>
The Crown thus exercised what was virtually a power of
veto over all aids taken by mesne lords. Such a right,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>conscientiously used, would have placed an effectual restraint
on their rapacity. John, however, employed it solely for
his own advantage, selling writs to every needy lord who
proposed to enrich himself (and, incidentally, the Crown also)
at his tenants’ expense.</p>

<p class='c001'>Magna Carta forbade the two tyrants thus to combine
against the sub-tenants, enunciating a hard-and-fast rule
which, if duly observed, would have struck at the root of
the grievance. The whole subject of aids was removed
from the region of royal caprice into the region of settled
law. No writ could be lawfully issued except on the three
well-known occasions.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>The Influence of Magna Carta upon later Practice.</i>
This chapter, along with chapters 12 and 14, was discarded
by Henry III.; and little difference, if any, can be traced
between the practices that prevailed before and after 1215.
Only in one particular were the requirements of John’s
Magna Carta observed, namely, as regards the need for
obtaining a royal licence. Mesne lords after this date,
whatever may have been their reason, invariably asked the
Crown’s help to collect their aids. They could not legally
distrain their freeholders, except through the sheriff, and
this was, in part at least, a result of Magna Carta.<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c017'><sup>[521]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Henry III., however, entirely disregarded the rule which
forbade the licensing of extraordinary aids. Like his
ancestors, he was prepared to grant writs on almost any
plausible pretext. From the <cite>Patent</cite> and <cite>Close Rolls</cite>, as
well as from other sources, illustrations of the Crown’s
earlier and later practice may readily be collected.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>Scutages.</i> In 1217, for example, Henry granted
permission to all Crown tenants who had served in person
to collect scutage from their knights.<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c017'><sup>[522]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>Ordinary Aids.</i> (<i>a</i>) John in 1204 authorized the
collection of “an effectual aid” from the knights and freeholders
of the Constable of Chester for the ransom of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>lord.<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c017'><sup>[523]</sup></a> (<i>b</i>) A royal writ in 1235 allowed Henry Tracey, as
already mentioned, to take an aid for his eldest daughter’s
marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <i>Special Aids.</i> (<i>a</i>) When a <em>fine</em> of sixty marks was
incurred in 1206 by the Abbot of Peterborough, John
allowed him to distrain his under-tenants for contributions.<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c017'><sup>[524]</sup></a>
(<i>b</i>) An heir, paying <em>relief</em>, might likewise transfer the
obligation to his freeholders.<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c017'><sup>[525]</sup></a> (<i>c</i>) The lord’s <em>debts</em> were
frequently paid by his tenants. The returns to the Inquest
of 1170 contain particulars of the “sums given individually
by some forty burgesses of Castle Rising towards paying off
the mortgages of their lord, the Earl of Arundel, who was
clearly in the hands of the Jews”;<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c017'><sup>[526]</sup></a> while in 1234 the Earl
of Oxford and the Prior of Lewes each obtained a letter
patent distraining their tenants to contribute to the discharge
of their debts.<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c017'><sup>[527]</sup></a> Sufficient evidence is thus preserved that
Henry III. took full advantage of the omission from his
own charters of this part of his father’s promises. He did
not question too minutely the justice of applications for
such writs, if good fees were punctually paid. His letters,
during the earlier years of his reign, authorized the taking
of a “reasonable” aid, without hinting at any mode of
determining what that was. This is illustrated by the
procedure adopted by Henry Tracey in 1235, who apparently
debated with his assembled knights of Devonshire
the amount to be paid as “reasonable,” and finally accepted
20s. per fee.<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c017'><sup>[528]</sup></a> It is interesting to note, however, that this
same mesne lord, twelve years later, obtained a writ
bidding the sheriff of Somerset assist him to collect “the
scutage of Gascony” at a specified rate, namely, 40s.
per fee.<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c017'><sup>[529]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>The first Statute of Westminster virtually reverted to the
rule laid down in 1215, for its terms imply that aids could
only be taken on the three well-known occasions. The
vague declaration that these should be reasonable in amount
is replaced by the specification of a fixed rate, namely 40s., or
double what had been usual at an earlier period. Definition
of the amount and times of payment may, however,
have been worth purchasing even at this increase.</p>

regards <em>scutage</em>, a distinction was recognized. The lord who actually paid
scutage might collect it from his sub-tenants without a licence; but, if he
served in person, he could recover none of his expenses except by royal
writ. See <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ibid.</i></span>, and cf. Madox, I. 675. It is necessary, however, to avoid

</div>

<p class='c001'>For military tenants, the transition from scutage to service
was a natural one; since it was not enough to protect
themselves from exactions in money, if they were still
exposed to arbitrary exactions in kind. John, therefore,
declared that no freeholder should be constrained to do
more service for his lands than he was legally bound to do.
Disputes might arise, however, as to what extent of service
actually was due in each particular case, and Magna Carta
did nothing to remove such ambiguities. The difficulties of
definition, indeed, were enormous, since the duration and
conditions of service might vary widely even among tenants-in-chivalry,
in consequence of special exemptions or special
burdens which appeared in title deeds or rested upon
immemorial usage. The barons would be unwilling to enter
on so intricate and laborious a task, fearing that the introduction
of such complications might do more harm than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>good. The necessity for accurate definition may never have
occurred to them: the main purport of their grievance was
so vividly present to their own minds that they did not
acknowledge the possibility of any mistake. The military
Crown tenants had frequently objected to serve abroad,
particularly during John’s campaigns in Poitou, which involved
a long expensive journey to a region in which they
had nothing at stake.<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c017'><sup>[530]</sup></a> They regarded themselves as not
legally bound to make expeditions to such portions of
the Angevin Empire as had not belonged to the Norman
kings when their ancestors got their fiefs. To force them to
enter on campaigns to the south of France, or to fine them
heavily for staying at home, was, they argued, to distrain
them <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad faciendum majus servicium de feodo militis quam
inde debetur</i></span>. When they inserted these words in the
Charter, they doubtless regarded them as an absolute prohibition
of compulsory service in Poitou, at all events.<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c017'><sup>[531]</sup></a> The
clause was wide enough, however, to include many minor
grievances connected with service. The barons did not
confine its provisions to military service even, but
extended it to other forms of freehold tenure (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nec de alio
libero tenemento</i></span>”). No freeholder, whether in socage,
serjeanty, or frankalmoin, could in future be compelled
to render services not legally due.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the barons thought they had thus settled the vexed
questions connected with foreign service, they deceived themselves.
Although this chapter (unlike those dealing with
scutage) remained in full force in all subsequent confirmations,
it was far from preventing disputes. Yet the disputants in
future reigns occupied somewhat different ground. From
the days of William I. to those of <a id='corr307.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Charles II'>Charles II.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_307.31'><ins class='correction' title='Charles II'>Charles II.</ins></a></span>, when the
feudal system was abolished, quarrels frequently arose, the
most famous of which culminated in 1297 in Edward’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>unseemly wrangle with the Earls of Norfolk and Hereford,
whose duty it was to lead the royal army as hereditary
Constable and Marshal respectively, but who refused point-blank
to embark for Gascony except in attendance on the
king’s person.<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c017'><sup>[532]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It has been shown in the Historical Introduction<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c017'><sup>[533]</sup></a> how
the obligations of a military tenant fell naturally into three
groups (services, incidents, and aids), while a fourth group
(scutages) was added when the Crown had adopted the
expedient of commuting military service for its equivalent
value in money.</p>

<p class='c001'>Feudal grievances also may be arranged in four corresponding
groups, each redressed by special clauses of Magna
Carta: abuse of <em>aids</em> by chapters 12, 14, and 15; abuse
of the feudal <em>incidents</em>, by chapters 2 to 8; abuse of
<em>scutage</em>, by chapters 12 and 14; and abuse of <em>service</em>, by
the present chapter, which thus completes the long list of
provisions intended to protect tenants against their
feudal lords.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>An attempt was here made to render royal justice
cheaper and more accessible. Law-suits in which the
Crown had no special interest, common pleas, were to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>held in some one, fixed, pre-appointed spot, and must no
longer follow the king as he moved about from place
to place. The full extent of the boon conferred by this
reform will be better appreciated after a short consideration
of the method of dispensing justice adopted by
Henry II. and his sons.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>The Curia Regis as a Court of Law.</i> The evil
complained of was a characteristically medieval one, and
arose from the fact that all departments of government
were originally centred in the king and his household,
or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia Regis</i></span>, which performed royal and national
business of every kind. This <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia Regis</i></span>, indeed, united
in itself the functions of the modern Cabinet, of the
administrative departments (such as the Home Office, the
Foreign Office, and the Admiralty), and of the various
legal tribunals. It was the parent <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inter alia</i></span> of the Court
at St. James’s and the courts at Westminster. One result
of throwing so many and miscellaneous duties on a small
body of hard-worked officials was to produce a congestion
of business. Nothing could be done outside of the royal
household, and that household never tarried long in any
one spot. Everything was focussed to one point, but to
a point constantly in motion. Wherever the king went,
there the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia Regis</i></span>, with all its departments, went also.
The entire machinery of royal justice followed Henry II.,
as he passed, sometimes on the impulse of the moment,
from one of his favourite hunting seats to another.
Crowds thronged after him in hot pursuit, since it was
difficult to transact business of moment elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c001'>This entailed intolerable delay, annoyance, and expense
upon litigants who brought their pleas for the
king’s decision. The case of Richard d’Anesty is often
cited in illustration of the hardships which this system
inflicted upon suitors. His own account is extant and gives
a graphic record of his journeyings in search of justice,
throughout a period of five years, during which he visited
in the king’s wake most parts of England, Normandy,
Aquitaine, and Anjou. The plaintiff, although ultimately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>successful, paid dearly for his legal triumph. Reduced
to borrow from the Jews to meet his enormous outlays,
mostly travelling expenses, he had to discharge his debts
with accumulations of interest at the ruinous rate of
86⅔ per cent.<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c017'><sup>[534]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Common Pleas and Royal Pleas.</i> Long before 1215
all litigations conducted before the king’s courts had come
to be divided roughly into two classes, according as the
royal interests were or were not specially affected by the
issue. Those on one side of this fluctuating line were
known as royal pleas, or “pleas of the Crown,” provisions
for holding which are contained in chapter 24, those on
the other side as ordinary pleas or “common pleas,” to
which alone the present chapter refers. As these ordinary
suits did not require to be determined in the royal
presence, it was therefore possible to appoint a special
bench of judges to sit permanently in some fixed spot,
to be selected once for all as likely to suit the convenience
of litigants. No town was named in Magna
Carta; but Westminster, even then the natural home of
law, was probably intended from the first. It is Westminster
that Sir Frederick Pollock has in mind when
he writes in reference to this chapter: “We may also
say that Magna Carta gave England a capital.”<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c017'><sup>[535]</sup></a> The
barons in 1215, however, in asking this reform, were
not insisting on any startling innovation, but demanding
merely the strict observance of a rule long recognized.
During most of John’s reign, a court did sit at Westminster
dispensing justice, with more or less regularity; and there
most “common pleas” were tried, unless John ordered

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>III. <i>Effects of Magna Carta on the genesis of the three
Courts of Common Law.</i> The ultimate consequences of the
accomplishment of this reform reached further than was
foreseen. Intended merely to remove from litigants a
practical grievance of frequent occurrence, it had important
indirect effects on the development of the English Constitution.
By securing for common pleas a permanent home, it
gave an impetus to the disintegrating tendencies already at
work within the many-sided household of the king. It
contributed somewhat to the slow process whereby the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia Regis</i></span>, as an administrative organ, was differentiated
from the same <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia</i></span> as the dispenser of justice. It
helped forward the cleavage destined to divide completely
the future Courts of Westminster from the Court of St.
James’s and from Downing Street. Nor was this all:
the special treatment accorded to “common pleas” emphasized
the distinction between them and royal pleas,
and so contributed to the splitting up of the same <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia
Regis</i></span>, on its judicial side, into two distinct tribunals.
One little group of judges were set apart for hearing
common pleas, and were known as "the king’s Judges
of the Bench," or more briefly as “the Bench,” and at a
later date as the Court of Common Pleas. A second group,
reserved for royal pleas, became the court <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Coram Rege</i></span>,
known subsequently as the Court of King’s Bench. There
were thus two benches: a common bench for common
pleas and a royal bench for pleas of the Crown.<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c017'><sup>[537]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The double process by which these two small courts
separated themselves slowly from the parent court and
from each other began long prior to Magna Carta, and
was not completed before the close of the thirteenth
century. These benches were also closely linked with a
third bench, known for centuries as the Court of Exchequer,
which was in its origin merely one department of that
government bureau, the king’s financial Exchequer—that
office in which money was weighed and tested and the
royal accounts drawn up. Many disputes or pleas affecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Crown debts and debtors had to be there decided, and in
due time a special group of officials were set aside to try
these. These men, called, not judges, but “barons of the
exchequer,” formed what was in fact, though not in name, a
third bench or court of justice.</p>

<p class='c001'>All three of the Courts of Common Law—the Court of
King’s Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Court
of Exchequer—were thus offshoots of the king’s household.
In theory, each of these ought to have confined itself
to the special class of suits to which it owed its origin—to
royal pleas, common pleas, and exchequer pleas respectively;
but by a process well known to lawyers and law-courts
in all ages, each of them eagerly encroached on the
jurisdictions and the fees appropriate to the others, until
they became, for most purposes, three sister courts of
similar and co-ordinate authority. They were bound to
decide all suits according to the technical and inflexible
rules of common law; and their jurisdiction thus required
a supplement, which was supplied by the genesis of the
Court of Chancery, dispensing, not common law, but equity,
which professed to give (and, for a short time, actually did
give) redress on the merits of each case as it arose, unrestrained
by precedents and legal subtleties.</p>

<p class='c001'>IV. <i>The Evolution of the Court of Common Pleas.</i> The
comment usually made upon the present chapter is that
we have here the origin of the Court of Common Pleas.
Now, legal institutions do not spring, full-fledged, into
being. The Court of Common Pleas, like its sister Courts
of King’s Bench and Exchequer, was the result of a long
process of gradual separation from a common parent stem.
Prior to 1215 several tentative efforts seem to have
been made towards establishing each of these. On the
other hand, it is probable, nay certain, that long after
1215 the Court of Common Pleas did not completely
shake off either its early dependence upon the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia Regis</i></span>,
or yet its close connection with its sister tribunals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Three stages in the process of evolution may be emphasized.
(1) The earliest trace of the existence of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>definite bench of judges, set apart for trying common pleas,
is to be found in 1178, not in 1215. When Henry II.
returned from Normandy in the former year, he found
that there had been irregularities in his absence. To prevent
their recurrence, he effected certain changes in his
judicial arrangements, the exact nature of which is matter
of dispute. A contemporary writer<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c017'><sup>[538]</sup></a> relates how Henry
chose two clerks and three laymen from the officials of
his own household, and gave to these five men authority
to hear all complaints and to do right “<em>and not to recede
from his court</em>.” It was long thought that this marked the
origin of the Court of King’s Bench, but Mr. Pike<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c017'><sup>[539]</sup></a> has
conclusively proved that the bench thus established was
the predecessor, not of the royal bench, but rather of
the bench for common pleas.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1178, then, these five judges were set apart to hear
ordinary suits; but they were specially directed not to
leave Henry’s court; so that common pleas still “followed
the king,” even ordinary litigants in non-royal pleas having
to pursue the king in quest of justice as he passed from
place to place in quest of sport.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must not be supposed that the arrangement thus
made in 1178 settled the practice for the whole period of
thirty-seven years preceding the grant of Magna Carta.
On the contrary, it was merely one of many experiments
tried by that restless reformer, Henry of Anjou; and the
separate court then instituted may have been pulled down
and set up again many times. The bench which appears
in 1178 had probably, at best, a fitful and intermittent
existence. There is evidence, however, that some such
court did exist and did try common pleas in the reigns of
Richard and John.<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c017'><sup>[540]</sup></a> On the other hand, this tribunal had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>in John’s reign ceased to follow the king’s movements
habitually (thus disregarding the decree of 1178), and had
established itself at Westminster.<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c017'><sup>[541]</sup></a> It was in 1215 considered
an abuse for John to try a common plea elsewhere.
Times had changed since his father had granted as a boon
that a set of judges should remain constantly at “his
court” to try such cases.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) Magna Carta in 1215 gave authoritative sanction
to the already recognized rule that common pleas should
be tried at Westminster, instead of moving with the
king. No exceptions were henceforth to be allowed.
Young Henry renewed this promise, and the circumstance
of his minority favoured its strict observance. A mere boy
could not make royal progresses through the land dispensing
justice as he went. Accordingly, all pleas continued for
some twenty years to be heard at Westminster. The
same circumstances, which thus emphasized the stability
of common pleas (along with all other kinds of pleas)
in one fixed place, may have arrested the process of
cleavage between the two benches. All the judges of
both courts sat at Westminster, and therefore there was
the less need for allocating the business between them
with any exactitude. The two benches were in danger of
coalescing.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) About the year 1234 a third stage was reached.
Henry began to follow the precedent, set by his ancestors,
of moving through his realm with judges in his train, hearing
pleas wherever he stopped. While one group of judges
went with him, another remained at Westminster. Some
way of allocating the business had therefore to be found.
Common pleas, in accordance with Magna Carta, remained
stationary; while pleas of the Crown went on their travels.
The split between the two benches now became absolute.
Each provided itself with separate records. From the year
1234, two continuous series of distinct rolls can be traced,
known respectively as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rotuli placitorum coram rege</i></span> and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rotuli placitorum de banco</i></span>. If any date in the history of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>one law court, which is in process of becoming two, can
be reckoned as specially marking the point of separation,
it should be that at which separate rolls appear. The
court’s <em>memory</em> lies in its records, which are thus closely
associated with its identity. In 1234 the common bench
and the royal bench had become distinct.<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c017'><sup>[542]</sup></a> Evidence
drawn from a few years later proves that a definition of
common pleas had been arrived at and that the rule which
required them to be held “in a fixed place” was insisted
on. While Henry and his justices sat in judgment at
Worcester in 1238, a litigant protested against his suit
being tried before them. It was a “common plea” and
therefore, he argued, ought not to follow the king, in violation
of Magna Carta. At Westminster only, not at Worcester
or elsewhere, could his case be heard.<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c017'><sup>[543]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With royal pleas, however, it was very different: for
long they continued to follow the king’s person without
any protest being raised; and the Court of King’s Bench
did not finally settle at Westminster for nearly a century
after the Court of Common Pleas had been established
there. So late as 1300, Edward I. ordained by the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Articuli super cartas</cite></span> that “the Justices of his Bench”
(as well as his Chancellor) should follow him so that
he might have at all times near him “some sages of the
law, which be able duly to order all such matters as
shall come into the Court at all times when need shall
require.”<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c017'><sup>[544]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>V. <i>Erroneous Views.</i> In the reign of Edward I. the
real motive of this chapter of Magna Charta—so quickly
had the organization of the law courts progressed—had
already been lost sight of. The day of wandering common
pleas, such as that of Richard d’Anesty, had been long
forgotten. Some litigants of Edward’s time had, however,
a different grievance of their own, connected with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>hearing of their suits. The Court of Exchequer was willing,
for an adequate consideration, to place its specially
potent machinery, devised originally for the king’s exclusive
use, at the disposal of private creditors, thus
treating “common pleas” as “exchequer pleas.” Ordinary
debtors, summoned as defendants before the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones scaccarii</i></span>,
were subjected to harsher treatment than they would have
experienced elsewhere. It was not unnatural that defendants
who found themselves thus hustled should read
the words of Magna Carta relative to “common pleas”
as precisely suited to their own case. They made this
mistake the more readily as the original motive had been
forgotten. The Charter was thus read as preventing the
stationary Court of Exchequer (not the constantly moving
King’s Bench) from hearing ordinary suits. This erroneous
view received legislative sanction. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Articuli super
cartas</cite></span> in 1300 declared that no common pleas should
thenceforth be held in the Exchequer “contrary to the
form of the Great Charter.”<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c017'><sup>[545]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This is a clear misinterpretation of the intention of
Magna Carta. The Exchequer never “followed the Crown”;
it stayed at Westminster where its offices, tallies, and pipe
rolls were. The Charter would have expressed itself in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>widely different words if it had desired to exclude common
pleas from the Exchequer. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Articuli super Cartas</cite></span>, however,
attempted what the Charter of 1215 did not. After
1300 it was clearly illegal to hold any pleas in the Exchequer,
unless such as affected the Crown and its ministers.
Subsequent statutes confirmed this; but their plain intention
was always defeated by the ingenious use of legal
fictions and the connivance of the Barons of Exchequer,
who welcomed the increase of their fees which kept pace
with the increase of business.<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c017'><sup>[546]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The evil directly attacked by Magna Carta was something
quite different—an evil wider, more pressing and less
technical, namely, the practice of causing ordinary litigants,
with their legal advisers and witnesses, to dance attendance
on a constantly moving court.</p>

the erroneous view that c. 17 of the Great Charter relates to the
Exchequer; so does Mr. Bigelow (<cite>History of Procedure</cite>, 130–1), who
goes further astray by explaining the point of the grievance as the
difficulty of getting speedy justice at the Exchequer, because the barons
refused to sit after their fiscal business had been finished, at the Easter
and Michaelmas sessions. This is an error: the Barons of Exchequer
made no difficulty about hearing pleas: quite the contrary. Plaintiffs
were equally eager to purchase the writs which they were keen to
sell: it was only defendants (debtors) who objected to the rapid and
stringent procedure for enforcing payment adopted by this efficient court.
The sheriffs and others waiting to render accounts before the Exchequer
also protested against the congestion of business produced at the Exchequer
by the eagerness of litigants who pressed there for justice. See
Madox, II. 73. Plaintiffs had no reason to complain.</p>

to answer the debts they owed to the king.” See Madox, II. 192.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Provision is thus made for holding before the king’s
travelling justices, frequently and in a convenient manner,
three species of judicial inquests known as “the three petty
assizes.” These are of exceptional interest, not only in
relation to Magna Carta, but from their intimate connection
with several constitutional problems of prime importance;
with the reforms of Henry II. on the one hand, and with
the genesis of trial by jury and of the Justices of Assize
on the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>The Curia Regis and the travelling Justices.</i> From
an early date, certainly from the accession of Henry I.,
it was the Crown’s practice to supplement the labours
which its officials conducted within the precincts of the
royal exchequer by the occasional despatch of chosen
individuals to inspect the provinces in the royal interests,
collecting information and revenue, and, incidentally, hearing
lawsuits. Justice was thus dispensed in the king’s
name by his delegates in every shire of England, and a
distinction arose between two types of royal courts: (1) <i>the
King’s Council and its offshoots</i> (including the three courts
of common law and the court of chancery) which at first
followed the king’s person, but gradually, as already
shown,<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c017'><sup>[549]</sup></a> found a settled home at Westminster; and (2) <i>the
courts of the itinerant justices</i> which exercised such delegated
authority as the Crown chose from time to time to entrust
to them. The natural sphere of the labours of these royal
commissioners as they passed from district to district was
the court of each shire, specially convened to meet them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>They formed in this way the chief link between the old
local popular courts and the system of royal justice
organized by Henry II.,<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c017'><sup>[550]</sup></a> subordinating the former to the
latter, until the county courts virtually became royal courts.
These travelling justices passed through two stages, two
different types receiving royal recognition at different periods,
the Justices in Eyre and the Justices of Assize respectively.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>a</i>) <i>The Justices in Eyre</i> were the earliest form of
travelling judges, though their original duties were rather
financial and administrative, than strictly judicial. Their
history extends from the reign of Henry I. to the end
of the fourteenth century.<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c017'><sup>[551]</sup></a> Their outstanding characteristics
were the sweeping nature of the commissions under
which they acted (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad omnia placita</i></span>), the harsh and drastic
way in which they used their authority, and their intense
unpopularity. Their advent was dreaded like a pestilence:
each district they visited was left impoverished by fines
and penalties. On one occasion, the men of Cornwall
“from fear of their coming, fled to the woods.”<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c017'><sup>[552]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>An eyre was only resorted to at long intervals—every
seven years came to be the recognized term—and was
intended as a severe method of punishing delinquencies
and miscarriages of justice occurring since the last one,
and of collecting arrears of royal dues. It was not a visit
from these universally-hated Justices of Eyre that the
barons in 1215 demanded four times a year.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) <i>The Justices of Assize</i> were also travelling judges, but
in their original form at least, possessed hardly another
feature in common with the Justices in Eyre. Their
history extends from a period not earlier than the reign of
Henry II. down to the present day.<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c017'><sup>[553]</sup></a> They seem to have
been popular from the first, as their primary function was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>to determine pending suits by a rational and acceptable
form of procedure; while the scope of their jurisdiction,
although gradually extended as their popularity increased,
was at all times limited strictly by the express terms of
their commissions. They were regarded not as royal tax-gatherers
armed with harsh powers of coercion, but as welcome
bearers of justice to the doors of those who needed it.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first their duties were confined to one species of
judicial work, namely, to presiding at enquiries of the kind
specially mentioned in the text. These particular inquests
were known as “assizes,” and the new species of travelling
judges were hence called “Justices of Assize,” a name which
has clung to them for centuries, although their jurisdiction
has been gradually increased till it now includes both civil
and criminal pleas of every description, and although meanwhile
the invention of new forms of process has superseded
the old “assizes,” and at last necessitated their total
abolition.<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c017'><sup>[554]</sup></a> They are still “justices of assize” in an age
which knows nothing of assizes.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>The Nature and Origin of the three Petty Assizes.</i> The
institution of the "assizes"—particular forms of the sworn
inquest—occupied a prominent place among the expedients
by which Henry II. hoped to substitute a more rational
procedure for the form of proof known as trial by combat.<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c017'><sup>[555]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span>, introduced at the Norman Conquest,
remained for a century thereafter the chief method in use
among the upper classes for determining all serious pleas or
litigations. Gradually, however, it was confined to two
important groups of pleas, one civil and the other criminal:
namely, appeals of treason and felony on the one hand, and
suits to determine the title to land on the other.<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c017'><sup>[556]</sup></a>
This process of restriction was accelerated by the deliberate
policy of Henry II., who attempted, indeed, to carry it
much further, devising machinery which provided for the
defendant or accused party, wherever possible, an option by
resorting to which he could, in an ever increasing variety of
circumstances, escape trial by battle altogether. Under
chapter 36 will be explained the expedient adopted for
evading combat in an appeal of treason or felony. The
present chapter relates to the procedure devised by Henry
for superseding the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span> in certain important groups of
civil pleas,<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c017'><sup>[557]</sup></a> and incidentally affords proof that this part of
his reforms had already become popular with the opponents
of the Crown. The frequent use of the three Petty Assizes
was now insisted on, although the Grand Assize was still
viewed askance for reasons to be explained in connection
with chapter 34.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>The Grand Assize</i> is not mentioned in Magna Carta;
but some acquaintance with it is a necessary preliminary to a
proper appreciation of the Petty Assizes. In the troubled
reign of Stephen—which was rather the reign of anarchy
in his name—lands changed hands frequently. This left
to his successor a legacy of quarrels, too often leading
to bloodshed. There was hardly an important estate in
England to which, at Henry’s accession, two or more rival
magnates did not lay claim. Constant litigations resulted,
and the only legal method of deciding the issue was the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>At some uncertain date, near the commencement of his
reign, Henry II. introduced a startling innovation. The
holder of a property <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de facto</i></span> (that is the man in actual
enjoyment of the estate in virtue of a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bona fide</i></span> title), when
challenged to combat by a rival claimant was allowed an
option: he might force the claimant (if the latter persisted)
to refer the whole matter to the oath of twelve knights of
the neighbourhood. Henry’s ordinance laid down careful
rules for the appointment of these recognitors. Four
leading knights of the whole county were first to be
chosen, on whom was placed the duty of selecting twelve
knights of the particular district where the lands lay,
and these, with all due solemnity and in presence of the
king’s justiciars, declared upon oath to which suitor the
lands belonged. Their decision was final, and determined
the question of ownership for all time coming.<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c017'><sup>[558]</sup></a> The
name Grand Assize was applied alike to the procedure
and to the knights who gave the verdict. The twelve
knights thus anticipated the functions of a modern jury,
while the king’s justiciars acted like the presiding judge at
a modern trial.<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c017'><sup>[559]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Valuable as was this innovation, it had one obvious
defect. The option it conferred might sometimes be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>usurped by the wrong man. It was intended to operate in
the interests of order and justice by favouring the peaceable
holder <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de facto</i></span>; but what if a turbulent and lawless
claimant, scorning an appeal to legal process, took the law
into his own hands, evicted the previous holder by the rude
method of self-help, and thereafter claimed the protection of
Henry’s ordinance? In such a case the man of violence—the
holder <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mala fide</i></span>—would enjoy the option intended for
his innocent victim.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>The petty assizes</i> may, perhaps, be regarded as the
outcome of Henry’s determination to prevent such misuse
of his new engine of justice. If one claimant alleged
that the other had usurped his rights by violence or
fraud, the king allowed the preliminary plea thus raised to
be summarily decided by the oath of twelve local landowners,
according to a procedure known as a petty assize.
These petty assizes, of which there were three kinds, all
related to questions of “possession,” as opposed to questions
of “ownership,” which could only be determined by battle
or by the Grand Assize.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>a</i>) <i>The assize of novel disseisin.</i> The word “seisin,”
originally synonymous with “possession” in general, was
gradually restricted by medieval lawyers to the possession
of real estate. “Disseisin” thus meant the interruption of
seisin or possession of land; and was the technical term
applied to such violent acts of eviction as were likely to
defeat the intention of Henry’s ordinance of the Grand
Assize. “Novel” disseisin implied that such violent ejection
was of comparatively recent date, for a summary remedy
could only be given where there had not been undue delay
in applying for it. The first of the petty assizes, then, was
a rapid and peaceable method of ascertaining by reference to
sworn local testimony whether an alleged recent eviction had
really taken place or not. Without any of the law’s delays,
without any expensive journeys to the king’s Court or to
Westminster, but in a rapid manner and in the district
where the lands lay, twelve local <a id='corr323.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='gentleman'>gentlemen</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_323.37'><ins class='correction' title='gentleman'>gentlemen</ins></a></span> determined
upon oath all allegations of this nature. If the recognitors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>of the petty assize answered “Yes,” then the evicted man
would have “seisin” immediately restored to him, and along
with “seisin” went the valued option of determining what
proof should decide the "ownership"—whether it should be
battle or the Grand Assize. An ordinance instituting this
most famous of the three petty assizes was issued probably
in 1166, a year fertile in legal expedients, and formed
a necessary supplement to the ordinance of the Grand
Assize, preventing all danger that the option intended for
the man of peace should be usurped by the man of
violence.<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c017'><sup>[560]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) <i>The assize of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mort d’ancestor</span>.</i> The protection afforded
to the victim of a “novel disseisin” did not remove all
possibility of justice miscarrying. Interested parties, other
than the man forcibly ejected, even his heirs, were left
unprotected. Further, an heir might be forcibly deprived
of his tenement either by his lord or by some other rival
claimant before he had an opportunity to take possession;
never having been “in seisin,” he could not plead that he
had suffered “disseisin.” For the benefit of such an heir,
a second petty assize, known as "mort d’ancestor," was invented.<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c017'><sup>[561]</sup></a>
This is mentioned in article 4 of the Assize of
Northampton, an ordinance issued by Henry in 1176; and
this earliest known reference probably marks its origin.
Procedure, essentially similar to, though not quite so speedy
or informal as, that already described was thus put at the
heir’s disposal. If successful, he took the lands temporarily,
subject to all defects in his ancestor’s title, leaving as
before the question of absolute ownership to be determined
(if challenged) by the more cumbrous machinery of the
Grand Assize.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>(<i>c</i>) <i>The assize of darrein presentment.</i> Advowson or the
right of appointing the incumbent to a vacant church
benefice was then, as now, a species of real estate. Such
patronage was highly prized, affording as it did an opportunity
of providing a living for a younger son or needy
relative; or it might be converted into ready cash. Disputes
often arose both as to the possession and as to the
ownership of advowsons. Any one who claimed the
absolute right or property as against the holder must do so
by battle or the Grand Assize, exactly as in the case of any
other form of real estate; and the Charter says nothing on
this head.<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c017'><sup>[562]</sup></a> On the other hand, the less vital question of
possession might be more rapidly determined. If a benefice
fell vacant, and each of two proprietors claimed the
patronage, the Church could not remain without a shepherd,
for years perhaps, until the question of title was decided.
No; the man in possession was allowed to make the
appointment. But who was the man in possession? Clearly
he who had (or whose father had) presented a nominee to
the living when the last vacancy occurred. Even here there
was room for dispute as to the facts. Twelve local men
decided which claimant had actually made the last appointment
(the “darrein presentment”); and the claimant thus
preferred had a legal right to fill up vacancies, remaining
in possession until someone proved a better title by battle
or the Grand Assize.</p>

<p class='c001'>All three forms of the petty assize were merely new
applications by Henry Plantagenet of the royal procedure
known in England, since the Norman Conquest, as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inquisitio</i></span>
or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>recognitio</i></span>.<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c017'><sup>[563]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>The Assizes in 1215.</i> The petty assizes, when
invented by Henry II., were resented bitterly as innovations;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>but public opinion, half a century later, had abundantly
vindicated the wisdom of this part of his reforms.
The insurgent barons in 1215 were far from demanding
their abolition; their new grievance was rather that
sessions of the justices of assize were not held often
enough. They prescribed the way in which these assizes,
now grown so popular, were to be held, and several points
were specially emphasized. (1) No inquiry of the kind
was to be held elsewhere than in the county where the
property was situated. Justice was in such cases to be
brought to every landowner’s door, although pleas of the
Crown might still follow the king, and ordinary common
pleas had to be taken to Westminster. This was intended
to save expense and to meet the convenience of litigants,
of those who served on assizes, and of all concerned.<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c017'><sup>[564]</sup></a>
Within two years, however, it was seen that this provision
went too far. It was more convenient to hold certain
inquiries before the Bench at Westminster than in the
particular locality. The reissue of 1217 therefore made
two important modifications: (<i>a</i>) All assizes of darrein
presentment were thereafter to be taken before “the
Justices of the Bench.” (<i>b</i>) Any assize of novel disseisin
or of mort d’ancestor revealing points of special difficulty,
might also be reserved for the decision of the Bench. An
element of uncertainty was thus introduced, of which the
Crown took advantage. In a reported case of the year
1221 it was decided that an assize of mort d’ancestor
should be held in its own county, not at Westminster.<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c017'><sup>[565]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) John’s Charter further insists on quarterly circuits
of Justices of Assize; so that litigants in every county
of England might have four opportunities each year of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>having their disputes amicably settled. Such excessive
frequency was quite uncalled for, and involved unnecessary
expense on the king, and an amount of labour on his
officers out of all proportion to the good effected. The
Charter of 1217, accordingly, provided that a circuit should
be made only once a year. In 1285, however, it was
enacted that they might be held three times a year, but
not oftener.<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c017'><sup>[566]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(3) The Charter speaks of the two justices and of the
four county knights, but says nothing of the twelve knights
from the immediate neighbourhood of the disputed property.
The omission has no special significance. Magna Carta
had no directions to convey on this matter, and therefore
it kept silence; but the presence of the twelve must have
been presumed, since their verdict formed the essential
feature of the entire procedure.<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c017'><sup>[567]</sup></a> The twelve formed the
jury, and the two justices were the judges, while the chief
duty of the four was to select the twelve. The chapter
directed the justices “to hold the assizes along with the
four knights”; but it does not appear whether the latter
were to sit as local assessors of the court, or to serve along
with the twelve recognitors, or to act as a link between
the two.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) One fact about them was clearly stated, namely, the
mode of their appointment. The four knights were to be
“elected” in the county court (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cum quatuor militibus ...
electis per comitatum</i></span>), and much emphasis has been laid on
this provision by historians searching for ancient prototypes
of modern institutions. These knights have been warmly
welcomed as county magistrates elected on a more or less
extended suffrage.<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c017'><sup>[568]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As the provisions of the reissue of 1217 are more carelessly
expressed, and as in particular they contain no word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>implying “election,” it has been assumed that a change
in the mode of appointment was intended; that a step
tentatively taken towards representative local government
in 1215 was deliberately retraced two years later.<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c017'><sup>[569]</sup></a>
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Electus</i></span>” however, in medieval Latin was a vague word,
differing widely from the ideas usually associated with a
modern “election,” and applied indiscriminately to all
methods of appointment or selection, even to the proceedings
of officers engaged by Edward I. to compel the
enlistment of the best soldiers available for his army. The
twelve knights were to be “appointed,” not “elected,” in
the county court, and it remains doubtful whether the
sheriff, the magnates, or the body of the suitors, would
have secured the chief share in the appointment. No
evidence is forthcoming that any special importance was
attached in 1217 to the use of the word “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>electus</i></span>,” and its
omission may have been due to inadvertence.</p>

<p class='c001'>IV. <i>An Erroneous View.</i> Henry Hallam, commenting
on this chapter, seems to have misapprehended the issues
at stake. "This clause stood opposed on the one hand
to the encroachments of the king’s court, which might
otherwise, by drawing pleas of land to itself, have defeated
the suitor’s right to a jury from the vicinage:
and, on the other, to those of the feudal aristocracy,
who hated any interference of the Crown to chastise
their violations of law, or control their own jurisdiction."<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c017'><sup>[570]</sup></a>
Hallam thus interprets the chapter as denoting
a triumph of the old local popular courts over both the
king’s courts and the courts of the feudal magnates.
It denoted no such thing, but marked in reality a
triumph (so far as it went) of the king’s courts over the
tribunals of the feudal magnates—over the courts baron,
as they were afterwards called, the most important of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>the three courts into which manorial jurisdictions afterwards
split. The assizes, it is true, were to be taken
in the county court, but they were to be taken there
by the king’s justices, not by the sheriff. The county
courts by this time had fallen completely under the
domination of the king, and were to all intents and
purposes (and in especial for this purpose) royal courts.
The present chapter is thus conclusive evidence of the
triumph of the king’s justice over all rivals in three
important groups of pleas. Royal justice was the best
article in the market, and, in spite of all defects, deserved
the popularity which in this province it had
evidently won, even among the barons whose jurisdiction
it was superseding.</p>

<p class='c001'>V. <i>Later History of the Justices of Assize.</i> Whatever
may have been the exact date when there first went
on tour throughout England travelling judges entitled to
the description of “Justices of Assize,” such circuits,
once instituted, have continued to be held at more or
less regular intervals from the beginning of the thirteenth
century to the present day. Their jurisdiction steadily
widened under successive kings, from Henry II. to Edward
III.; and they gradually superseded the older Justices of
Eyre, taking over such of their functions as were not
inconsistent with the change that was gradually transforming
the medieval into the modern system of justice.<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c017'><sup>[571]</sup></a>
It was the custom for the Crown to issue new commissions
to the justices as they set out upon each new circuit.
Five distinct types of such commissions conferred jurisdiction
over five different departments of judicial business.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>The commission of assize</i> was the earliest of all,
authorizing them to hold petty assizes, but not the grand
assize. Of this sufficient has already been said.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>The commission of nisi prius</i> conferred a wider civil
jurisdiction, embracing practically all the non-criminal pleas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>pending at the time in the counties which they visited.
These powers were originally based on the terms of the
Statute of Westminster II., which became law in 1285,<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c017'><sup>[572]</sup></a>
and directed that all civil pleas (under certain exceptions)
might be heard in their own counties. Thenceforward most
ordinary suits might be tried either locally before the
justices of assize, or else before the bench at Westminster.
The statute directed, however, that sheriffs, in summoning
jurors to Westminster, were only to do so conditionally—jurors
were to attend there unless already (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nisi prius</i></span>) the
justices of assize had come into the county; that is, if the
justices arrived meanwhile in the locality, the jurors and all
others concerned were saved a journey, and the pleas
in question were heard on the spot. The commissions
under which the travelling justices heard locally such
civil pleas were therefore known as “Commissions of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nisi
prius</i></span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <i>The commission of gaol delivery</i> was, subsequently
to 1299, invariably conferred on the justices of assize, in
accordance with a statute of that year,<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c017'><sup>[573]</sup></a> authorizing them
to inspect all gaols and enquire into all charges against
prisoners, and to set free those unjustly detained. Previously,
similar powers had been spasmodically conferred
on separate commissioners, sometimes quite unfit for such
a trust, who had too often abused their authority.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <i>Commissions of Oyer and Terminer</i>, issued spasmodically
from as early a date as 1285,<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c017'><sup>[574]</sup></a> to more or less
responsible individuals, were from 1329 onwards conferred
exclusively on the justices of assize, who thus
obtained authority<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c017'><sup>[575]</sup></a> “to hear and determine” all criminal
pleas pending in the counties they visited. This, combined
with the commission of gaol delivery, amounted to
a full jurisdiction over crimes and criminals of every kind
and degree; just as the commissions of assize and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nisi
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>prius</i></span> combined gave them full jurisdiction over all civil
pleas.<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c017'><sup>[576]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(5) <i>The ordinary commission of the peace</i> was invariably
issued to the justices of assize from the reign of Edward
III., conferring on them powers similar to those of the local
justices of peace in every county which they might visit.</p>

<p class='c001'>By a process of the survival of the fittest the justices of
assize, from the small beginnings referred to in John’s
Great Charter, thus gradually gathered to themselves the
powers exercised originally by various rival sets of commissioners;
and they have continued for many centuries to
perform the functions conferred by these five different
commissions, forming a characteristic and indispensable
part of the judicial system of England.<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c017'><sup>[577]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f555'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r555'>555</a>. The name “Assize” is sometimes a source of confusion, because of the
various meanings which attach to it. (1) Originally it denoted a session or
meeting of any sort. (2) It came to be specially reserved for sessions of
the king’s Council. (3) It was applied to any Ordinance enacted by the
king in such a session, <i>e.g.</i> the Assize of Clarendon or the Assize of Northampton.
(4) It was extended to every institution or procedure established
by such royal ordinance, but (5) more particularly applied to the institutions
or procedures known as the Grand Assize, and the Petty Assizes,
from which the “Justices of Assize” took their name. (6) Finally, it
denotes at the present day a “session” of these Justices of Assize, thus
combining something of its earliest meaning with something of its latest. In
certain contexts it has other meanings still, <i>e.g.</i> (7) an assessment or
financial burden imposed at a “session” of the king’s council or of some
other authority.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r559'>559</a>. The various steps in the procedure ought to be clearly grasped, (<i>a</i>) A
claimant challenged the title of the actual tenant in the court baron of the
lord, from whom the tenement was held, and offered battle by a champion,
who was supposed to be a witness. (<i>b</i>) The tenant (now become a defendant)
applied to the king for a royal writ, the issue of which, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span>,
stopped all procedure in the court baron, (<i>c</i>) The claimant (plaintiff) had
thus to make the next move; and Henry’s ordinance left only one move which
he could make, namely to apply for a new royal writ, but one of a different
kind. This new writ referred the question of title to twelve knights of the
Grand Assize. (<i>d</i>) Before these could be appointed and give their verdict,
many formalities and delays necessarily intervened, involving expensive
journeys to the king’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia</i></span>, first by the four appointing knights and
afterwards by the twelve appointed. Months and even years might elapse
before the final verdict was obtained. This ingenious reform, while superseding
trial by battle, incidentally superseded also the jurisdiction of
mesne lords. Hence the Grand Assize never became popular with the
magnates. Cf. under c. 34.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f560'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r560'>560</a>. The date of the ordinance of the Grand Assize is not known. It has
been argued that its origin may be traced to an earlier date than that of
the assize of novel disseisin (see Mr. J. H. Round in the <cite>Athenaeum</cite> for
28th January, 1899); but in any case the <em>logical</em> sequence seems to be that
given in the text. The question of <em>chronological</em> sequence is still open.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f561'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r561'>561</a>. At so late a date as 1267 it was found necessary to recognize by statute

<p class='c001'><a href='#r562'>562</a>. Such was the law as late as 1285. The Statute of Westminster II. (13

presented a clerk to a vacant church, the real patron could not
recover his advowson except by a writ of right “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quod habet terminari per

less.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This supplement to the preceding chapter prescribed
the course to be followed when the press of other business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>had prevented some of the assizes on the agenda from
being disposed of on the court day. The shiremoot lasted
for one day only, and to hold an adjourned session of all
the suitors on the morrow would inflict hardship on those
whose presence was required elsewhere. The framers of
the charter were met by a dilemma in seeking to combine
the rapid dispatch of business with the minimum of inconvenience
to those who came to make the court.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Articles of the Barons had made two definite
demands not readily reconciled; namely that none save
jurors and the parties to pending suits should be summoned
to meet the justices of assize on their quarterly rounds
(article 8); and that assizes should be “shortened” (article
13), which simply meant that the law’s delays should
cease.</p>

<p class='c001'>The terms of Magna Carta, as befitted a carefully-drawn,
business-like document, were more precise. They made it
clear that assizes in the normal case should be held in
the county court—a point upon which the Articles had
been silent. This was a salutary provision, since a healthy
publicity accompanied the proceedings of the full shire-moot.
Nothing was said of “shortening” the procedure;
and the Charter showed its appreciation of the fact that
there might be more business than could be got through
in one day. If that happened, a compromise must be
made between the claims of litigants wishing their
pleas hastened and the desire of other people to be
discharged from further attendance. The justices were
directed to complete their labours on the morrow, but
were forbidden to retain anyone in attendance except the
actual parties to suits and a sufficient number of jurors.
Those whom Magna Carta thus compelled to wait a second
day were exactly those whose presence the Articles had
stipulated for upon the first day—not admitting, indeed,
the possibility that a second day might be required. The
discrepancy between the schemes of the two documents
might be explained on the supposition that the device of
timing the visit of the justices with the date of holding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>the monthly shiremoot was only thought of after the
Articles of the Barons had been sealed.<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c017'><sup>[578]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Charter of 1217 made a different provision for
the same contingency. Unfinished assizes need no longer
be taken in their own county on the day following
the county court, nor, indeed, on any other day. The
judges received full authority to bring them to a conclusion
elsewhere on their circuit according as it might
suit their convenience. This concession to the justices,
taken in connection with the further provisions of
1217, reserving all darrein presentments, together with
other assizes of any difficulty, for the decision of the
bench, shows a comparative disregard of the convenience
of jurors, who might, in the option of the justices, find
themselves compelled either to follow the assizes from
shire to shire, or else to undertake the irksome journey
to Westminster, from which the Charter of 1215 had
relieved them.<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c017'><sup>[579]</sup></a></p>

or one <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mort d’ancestor</i></span> might be held by itself; and complaint was made in
1258 that the sheriffs proclaimed in the market places that all knights and
freeholders must assemble for such an inquest, and when they came not,
amerced them at will (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro voluntate sua</i></span>). See Petition of Barons, c. 19

<div class='footnote' id='f579'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r579'>579</a>. Subsequent legislation vacillated between two policies, actuated at
times by a desire to restrain the discretionary powers of the justices;
and at others by experience of the way in which strict adherence to
inflexible rules was found to inflict hardships upon litigants. The Statute
of Westminster II. (13 Edward I. c. 30) confirmed the power of the justices
to reserve cases of mort d’ancestor for decision by the bench, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per
contra</i></span> allowed assizes of darrein presentment (which it associated in
this connection with inquests <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quare impedit</i></span>) to be taken “in their
own counties.” The Act 6 Richard II. c. 5 curtailed the discretionary
powers previously conferred, directing that justices assigned to take
assizes and to deliver gaols should hold sessions in the county towns in
which the shire courts were wont to be held. The Statute 11 Richard
II. c. 11 once more relaxed this rule, alleging that it had resulted in
the inconvenience of suitors. Therefore authority was given to the
chancellor, with the advice of the justices, to determine in what places
assizes might be held, notwithstanding the provisions of the Statute of
five years previous.</p>

men of the neighbourhood.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This is the first of three consecutive chapters which
seek to remedy grave abuses connected with royal amercements.
To understand fully what these were requires
some knowledge, not only of the system of legal procedure
of which they formed part, but also of previous systems.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Three stages of criminal law.</i> The efforts made in
medieval England to devise machinery for suppressing crime
took various forms. Three periods may be distinguished.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>The bloodfeud.</i> The earliest method of redressing
wrongs of which any evidence survives was the practice of
retaliation, or the bloodfeud. The injured man, or his heir
if he were dead, took the law into his own hands and
exacted satisfaction by the aid of battle-axe or spear. This
right of vengeance, formerly clothed with the entire sanction
of the law, had practically disappeared before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>dawn of authentic history in England; but its previous
existence may be confidently inferred from certain traces
which it left on the laws of a later period.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>Fixed money-payments.</i> At some early, but uncertain,
date it had become customary to accept money
in lieu of vengeance. The new practice, at first exceptional,
and applied to cases only of accidental injury, was gradually
extended to all cases in which the wronged individual was
willing to accept a compromise. It was made compulsory
on evil-doers to offer solatium in money for every crime
committed, and finally it was made compulsory also upon
the injured man to accept it when offered. At this stage
the right of private revenge had become almost a thing
of the past. It was lawful only after the aggrieved
individual had demanded, and been refused, compensation at
the recognized rate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Various codes formulated intricate rules for determining the
amounts thus payable. Each man had his own money value
or <i>wer</i> (from the simple freeman, reckoned at 200 shillings,
up to the prelates and lay nobles, estimated at much higher
figures). These were the legal values at which each man’s
life was appraised. Smaller wrongs could be compensated by
smaller sums in name of damages, known as <i>bots</i>: so much
for a foot, or an eye, or a tooth. The king or other feudal
lord exacted further payment from the wrong-doer, under
the name of <i>wites</i>, which are sometimes explained as the
price charged by the magistrate for enforcing payment
of the <i>wer</i> or <i>bot</i>; sometimes as sums due to the community,
on the ground that every evil deed inflicts a wrong on
society in general, as well as upon its victim.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <i>Amercements.</i> A third system succeeded. This was
of extreme simplicity and differed widely in many ways
from the complicated system it superseded. It is found
in full working order very shortly after the Norman
Conquest, but was still regarded as an innovation at the
accession of Henry I. It is known as the system of
amercements. None of our authorities contains an entirely
satisfactory account of how the change took place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>but the following suggestions may be hazarded. The sums
demanded from a wrong-doer, who wished to buy himself
back into the protection of the law, and into the community
of well-doers, became increasingly burdensome. He had to
satisfy the claims of the victim’s family, of the victim’s lord,
of the lord within whose territory the crime had been
committed, of the church, mayhap, whose sanctuary had been
invaded, of other lords who could show an interest of
any sort, and finally of the king as lord paramount. It
became practically impossible to buy back the peace once
it had been broken. The Crown, however, stepped in, and
offered protection on certain conditions: the culprit surrendered
himself and all that he had to the king, placing
himself “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in misericordiam regis</i></span>,” and delivering a tangible
pledge (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vadium</i></span>) as evidence and security of the surrender.<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c017'><sup>[580]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although in theory the wrongdoer put his property
unreservedly at the king’s disposal, there was a tacit
understanding that he should receive in return, not only
a free pardon, but also the restoration of the balance of
his effects, after the king had helped himself to a share.
Such a course, at first optional, would gradually come
to be followed with absolute uniformity. By-and-by, it
was assumed that every culprit wished to avail himself
of this means of escape, and thus the words “in mercy”
were written in court records as a matter of course, after
the name of every one convicted of a crime.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is easy to understand why the Norman kings favoured
this system; for the Crown thus got whatever it chose
to demand, while other claimants got nothing. Gradually,
then, the old complicated system of <i>wers</i> and <i>bots</i> and <i>wites</i>
became obsolete and was in time forgotten altogether; the
system of amercements reigned in its stead. Strictly speaking,
the man’s life and limbs and all that he had were at the
king’s mercy.<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c017'><sup>[581]</sup></a> The Crown, however, found that it might
defeat its own interests by excessive greed; and generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>contented itself with exacting moderate sums. Soon, rules
of procedure were formulated for its own guidance. The
amounts taken in each case were regulated partly by the
wealth of the offender, and partly by the gravity of the
offence. Further, it became a recognized rule that the
amount should be assessed by what was practically a jury
of the culprit’s neighbours; and attempts were also made
to fix a maximum.<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c017'><sup>[582]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Thus a sort of tariff grew up, defining the amounts to be
exacted for various offences of most general occurrence.
The Crown and its officials usually respected this in
practice, but never formally abandoned the right to demand
more. Such payments were known as “amercements” and
were always technically distinguished from “fines” (or
voluntary offerings). Records, still extant, of the reign of
John show us that for very petty offences, men were
constantly placed “in mercy”; for example, for failure to
attend meetings of the hundred or county court; for false
or mistaken verdicts; for petty infringements of the king’s
forest rights; and for a thousand other trivial faults.
Every man who raised an action and failed in it was amerced.
It will be readily understood how important it was that these
amercements, forming so tempting a source of revenue to
the exchequer, should not be abused. The Charter of
Henry I. (chapter 8) had promised a remedy, drastic
indeed but of a reactionary and impossible nature. He
there agreed to abolish altogether the system of amercements
(then of recent introduction) and to revert to the
earlier Anglo-Saxon system of bots and wites, already
discussed. This promise, like others, of Henry I. was made
only to be broken.<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c017'><sup>[583]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>II. <i>Magna Carta and Amercements.</i> All classes had an
interest in this subject, since no one could expect to
pass through life (perhaps hardly through a single year)
without being subjected to one or more amercements.
Three chapters of Magna Carta accordingly are occupied
with remedies. Chapter 20 seeks to protect the ordinary
layman; chapter 21, the barons; and chapter 22, the
clergy—thus vaguely anticipating the conception of three
estates of the realm;—commons, nobles and clergy. The
“third estate” is further analysed for the purposes at least
of this clause, into three subdivisions—the freeman, the
villein, and the merchant.<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c017'><sup>[584]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>The amercement of the freeholder.</i> The great object
of the reforms here promised was to eliminate the arbitrary
element; the Crown must conform to its own customary
rules. With this object, various safeguards were devised
to regulate the amercing of freemen. (<i>a</i>) For a petty
offence, only a petty sum could be taken. This was nothing
new: the records of John’s reign show that, both before and
after 1215, very small amounts were often taken: three-pence
was a common sum. (<i>b</i>) For grave offences, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>larger sum might be assessed, but not out of proportion to
the offence. (<i>c</i>) In no case must the offender be pushed
absolutely to the wall. His means of livelihood must be
saved to him. Even if all other effects of the defaulting
freeman had to be sold off to pay the amount assessed, he
was to retain his ancestral freehold (or “contenement,” a
word to be afterwards discussed). He might, however, find
himself liable for a large sum which he had to pay off
by instalments during many years. (<i>d</i>) Another clause
provided machinery for giving effect to all these rules. The
amount of the amercement must be fixed, not arbitrarily by
the Crown, but by impartial assessors, “by the oath of
honest men of the neighbourhood.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems probable that all these provisions were
declaratory of existing usage, that is of the usage of John’s
reign; but, apparently, a different procedure and one less
favourable to wrong-doers had been in vogue, so recently as
the reign of Henry II. Amercements had then been
assessed, not by local jurors but, by the barons of the
exchequer, who might, however, where arrears were still
due, revise their own findings of previous years.<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c017'><sup>[585]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Pipe Roll of the fourteenth year of Henry II.<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c017'><sup>[586]</sup></a> shows
how a certain priest, who in this respect stood on precisely
the same footing as a layman, had been placed “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in misericordiam</i></span>”
of 100 marks by William fitz John, one of the
king’s justices, but how that sum was afterwards reduced
to 40 marks “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per sacramentum vicinorum suorum</i></span>.” It seems
a safe inference that, on the priest pleading poverty, the
question of his ability to pay was referred to local recognitors
with the result stated. This priest was subsequently
pardoned altogether “because of his poverty.” His case
illustrates how an important change was gradually
effected. Local jurors first assisted, and then superseded,
the barons of exchequer in assessing the amounts payable as
amercements. This important boon, which transferred the
decision from unsympathetic Crown officials to the defaulter’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>own neighbours, was confirmed by Magna Carta to all
clergy and to all members of the third estate. It will be
shown, in connection with chapter 21, how earls and barons
lost a similar privilege.<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c017'><sup>[587]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>The amercement of the merchant.</i> The provisions in
favour of freeholders were extended to members of the
trading classes. One modification, however, had to be
made. In the normal case, the merchant’s means of livelihood
were his wares, not his freehold. These wares,
accordingly, were saved to him, not his “contenement” (if
he had one). The traders of many favoured towns, however,
had already gained special privileges in this as in other
matters, and these had received a general confirmation from
chapter 13 of the Great Charter. Some boroughs had
anticipated Magna Carta by obtaining in their own special
charters either a definition of the maximum amercement
exigible, or in some cases, by a definition of the amercing
body. Thus, John’s Charter to Dunwich of 29th June,
1200,<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c017'><sup>[588]</sup></a> provides that the burgesses shall only be amerced by
six men from within the borough, and six men from without.
The capital had special privileges: in his Charter to
the Londoners, Henry I. had promised that no citizen <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in
misericordia pecuniae</i></span> should pay a higher sum than 100s.
(the amount of his <i>wer</i>).<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c017'><sup>[589]</sup></a> This was confirmed in the
Charter of Henry II., who declared “that none shall be
adjudged for amercements of money, but according to the
law of the city, which they had in the time of King Henry,
my grandfather.”<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c017'><sup>[590]</sup></a> John’s Charter to London of 17th June,
1199, also specially referred to this;<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c017'><sup>[591]</sup></a> and the general
confirmation of customs contained in chapter 13 of Magna
Carta would further strengthen it. In all probability, it
covered trivial offences only (such as placed the offender in
the king’s hands <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de misericordia pecuniae</i></span>). The present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>chapter is wider in its scope, applying to great offences
as well as to small ones, and embracing merchants everywhere,
not merely the burgesses of chartered towns.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <i>The amercement of the villein.</i> The early history of
villeins as a class is enveloped in the mists which still
surround the debateable question of the rise of the English
manor. Notwithstanding the brilliant efforts of Mr.
Frederic Seebohm<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c017'><sup>[592]</sup></a> to find the origin of villeinage in
the status of the serfs who worked for Roman masters
upon British farms or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>villae</i></span> long before the Teutonic
immigrations began, an older theory still holds the field,
namely, that the abject villeins of Norman days were
the descendants of the free-born “ceorls” of Anglo-Saxon
times. On this theory—the orthodox one, and rightly
so, since it is supported by the greater weight of evidence—most
of England was once cultivated by free Anglo-Saxon
peasant proprietors originally grouped in little societies each
of which formed an isolated village. These free villagers
were known as “ceorls,” to distinguish them from the gentry
or nobility called “eorls,” who enjoyed social consideration
but (so it is usually argued) no unfair political advantages
on the score of their noble blood. The “ceorls” were
slowly sinking from their originally free estate during
several centuries prior to 1066: but the process of their
degradation was completed rapidly and roughly by the harsh
measures of the Norman conquerors. The bulk of the once
free peasantry were crushed down into the dependent villeins
of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whichever theory may be the correct one, the position,
economic, legal, and political, of the villeins in the thirteenth
century has at the present day been ascertained with
accuracy and certainty. Economically they were reckoned
part of the necessary equipment of the manor of their lord,
whose fields they had to cultivate as a condition of being
left in possession of acres which had once been, in a more
real sense, their own. The services to be exacted by the
owner of the manor, at first vague and undefined, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>gradually specified and limited. They varied from century
to century, from district to district, and even from manor to
manor; but at best the life of the villein was, as a contemporary
writer has described it, burdensome and wretched
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>graviter et miserabiliter</i></span>). After his manifold obligations
were discharged, little time was left him for the ploughing
and reaping of his own small holding. The normal villein
possessed his portion of land, of a virgate or half virgate in
extent (thirty or fifteen scattered acres) under a tenure
known as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>villenagium</i></span>, sharply distinguished from the freeholder’s
tenures, whether of chivalry, serjeanty, or socage.
He was a dependent dweller on a manor which he dared not
quit without his master’s leave. It is true that he had certain
rights of a proprietary nature in the acres he claimed
as his own; yet these were determined, not by the common
law of England, but by “the custom of the manor,” or virtually
at the will of the lord. These rights, such as
they were, could not be pled elsewhere than before the
court customary of that manor over which the lord’s
steward presided with powers wide and undefined. Legally
speaking, the villein was a tenant-at-will whom the lord
could eject without the interference of any higher tribunal
than his own. Politically, however, the position of the
villein was peculiar. While allowed to enjoy none of
the privileges, he was yet expected to perform some of the
duties, of the freeman. He attended at the shire and
hundred courts, acted on juries, and performed other public
functions, thus suffering still further encroachments on the
scanty portion of time which he might call his own, but
preserving for a brighter day some vague tradition of
his earlier liberty. The fact that such public duties were
performed by the villein, lends strong support to those who
argue in favour of his descent from the old “ceorl” who
enjoyed all the rights, as well as performed all the obligations,
of the free. Such duties would never have been
required from a race of hereditary slaves; but it is easy to
understand how men originally free might be gradually
robbed of their legal rights, while left to perform legal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>duties of a kind so useful to society and to their
masters.</p>

<p class='c001'>The words of this chapter of Magna Carta undoubtedly
extend some measure of protection to villeins. Two questions,
however, may be asked:—What measure, and from
what motive? Answers are called for, because of the
importance attached to this clause by writers who claim for
Magna Carta a popular or democratic basis. One thing
is clear: the villeins were protected from the abuse of
only such amercements as John himself might inflict,
not from the amercements of their manorial lords; for
the words used are “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>si inciderint in misericordiam nostram</i></span>.”
A villein in the king’s mercy shall enjoy the same consideration
as the freeholder or the merchant enjoys in
similar plight—his “wainage,” that is his plough with
its accoutrements, including possibly the oxen, being saved
to him. What is the motive of these restrictions?
It is usually supposed to have been clemency, the
humane desire not to reduce the poor wretch to absolute
beggary. It is possible, however, to imagine an entirely
different motive; the villein was the property of his lord,
and the king must respect the vested interests of others.
That he might do what he pleased with his own property,
his demesne villeins, seems clear from a passage usually
neglected by commentators, namely, chapter 16 of the
reissue of 1217. Four important words limiting the
restraints on the king’s power are there introduced—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>villanus
alterius quam noster</i></span>. The king was not to inflict absolutely
crushing amercements on any villeins “<em>other than his own</em>,”
thus leaving the villeins on ancient demesne unreservedly in
his power.<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c017'><sup>[593]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It must not be thought, however, that the position of the
king’s villeins—“tenants on ancient demesne,” as they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>technically called—was worse than that of the villeins of
an ordinary unroyal manor. On the contrary, it has been
clearly shown<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c017'><sup>[594]</sup></a> that the king’s peasants enjoyed privileges
denied to the peasants of other lords. Magna Carta—that
"bulwark of the people’s rights"—thus left the great bulk of
the rural population of England completely unprotected
from the tyranny of their lords in amercements as in other
things. The king must not take so much from any lord’s
villeins as to destroy their usefulness as manorial chattels;
that was all.<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c017'><sup>[595]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <i>The difference between fines and amercements.</i> In the
thirteenth century these terms were sharply contrasted.
“Amercement” was applied to such sums only as were
imposed in punishment of misdeeds, the law-breaker
amending his fault in this way. He had no option of
refusing, and no voice in fixing the amount assessed upon
him. “Fine,” on the contrary, was used for voluntary
offerings made to the king with the object of procuring
some concession in return—to obtain some favour or to
escape some punishment previously decreed. Here the
initiative rested with the individual, who suggested the
amount to be paid, and was, indeed, under no legal obligation
to make any offer at all. This distinction between
fines and amercements, absolute as it was in theory, could
readily be obliterated in practice. The spirit of the restriction
placed by this chapter and by the common law
upon the king’s prerogative of inflicting amercements could
usually be evaded by calling the sums exacted “fines.” For
example, the Crown might imprison its victims for an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>indefinite period, and then graciously allow them to offer
large payments to escape death by fever or starvation in a
noisome gaol. The letter of Magna Carta was in this way
strictly observed, since the prisoner was nominally as free
to abstain entirely from offering as was the king to reject
all offers until the figure was sufficient to tempt his greed.
Enormous <em>fines</em> might thus be taken; while royal officials
were strictly forbidden to inflict arbitrary <em>amercements</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the gradual elimination of the voluntary element
the word “fine” came to bear its modern meaning, while
“amercement” dropped out of ordinary use.<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c017'><sup>[596]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(5) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Contenement.</i></span> This word, which occurs in Glanvill<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c017'><sup>[597]</sup></a>
and in Bracton,<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c017'><sup>[598]</sup></a> and also (in its French form) in the
Statute of Westminster, I.,<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c017'><sup>[599]</sup></a> as well as in Magna Carta, has
formed a text for many laboured and unsatisfactory explanations
from the days of Sir Edward Coke<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c017'><sup>[600]</sup></a> to our own.</p>

<p class='c001'>There seems to be no real obscurity, however, since it is
clearly a compound of "tenement"—a word well known as
an exact technical term of feudal conveyancing—and the
prefix “con.” A “tenement” is precisely what a freeman
might be expected to have, namely, a freehold estate of
his own. The “con” merely intensifies the meaning, emphasizing
the closeness of the connection between the
freeman and his land. Any other tenements he had might
be taken away, without inflicting extreme hardship; but to
take from him his "contenement"—his ancestral lands—would
leave him poor indeed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The word occurs, not only in Glanvill and Bracton, but
also in several entries on the Exchequer Rolls of Henry III.
and Edward I., collected by Madox,<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c017'><sup>[601]</sup></a> and by him collated with
other entries which throw light on the way in which a
“contenement” might be saved to the man amerced. Thus
in 40 Henry III. the officials of the exchequer, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>discussing the case of an offender who had failed to pay an
amercement of 40 marks, ordered inquiry to be made, “how
much he was able to pay the king <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per annum</i></span>, saving his
own sustenance and that of his wife and children,” an
excerpt which illustrates also the more humane side of
exchequer procedure. In 14 Edward I. again, the officials
of that day, when ferreting out arrears, found that certain
poor men of the village of Doddington had not paid their
amercements in full. An inquiry was set on foot, and
the barons of exchequer were ordered to fix the dates at
which the various debtors should discharge their debts
(evidently an arrangement for payment by instalments)
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>salvo contenemento suo</i></span>.”<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c017'><sup>[602]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These illustrations of the actual procedure of later reigns,
in agreeing so closely with the rules laid down by the
Great Charter, show how a man’s contenement might be
saved to him without any loss to the Crown. Magna Carta
apparently desires that time should be granted in which
to pay up debts by degrees. Meanwhile, the amerced man
was not forced to sell such holding (or wares, or wainage)
as was necessary to maintain him with his wife and family.
Leniency, in the long run, might prove best for all concerned,
the Crown included.</p>

avoid unnecessary confusion, no mention has been made in the account
given above of a classification of amercements into three degrees, which
increases the obscurity surrounding their origin. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dialogus de
Scaccario</cite></span>, II. xvi., tells how (<i>a</i>) for grave crimes, the culprit’s life and
limbs were at the king’s mercy as well as his property; (<i>b</i>) for less important
offences, his lands were forfeited, but his person was safe; while (<i>c</i>) for
minor faults, his moveable effects only were at the king’s disposal. In the
last case, the offender was “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in misericordia regis de pecunia sua</i></span>.” Thus to
be “in mercy” did not always mean the same thing. Further, a villein or
dependent freeman on a manor might fall in the “mercy” of his lord, as
well as of the king. The records of manorial courts are full of petty
amercements for petty transgressions of the customs of the manor.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>The amercement of earls and barons.</i> The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barones majores</i></span>,
as matter of course, intended to secure for themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>privileges at least equal with those of the ordinary freeholder.
In assessing their amercements, both the gravity of the
offence and their ability to pay (as measured by their
property) would naturally be considered. Magna Carta
mentions only the former criterion—it was, indeed, unnecessary
to call the king’s attention to the fact that more could
be taken from their wealth than from the ordinary freeholder’s
comparative poverty. The saving of a “contenement”
to them would also naturally be assumed. One
vital difference, however, was distinctly stated. The amercing
body was not to be a jury of good men of the locality;
but a jury of their “peers.”<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c017'><sup>[603]</sup></a> The barons here asked only
what was their undoubted right—to have the amount of
their forfeits determined neither by their feudal inferiors
(freeholders of their own or of other mesne lords) nor yet by
Crown officials, but by magnates of their own position and
with interests in common. This was not an innovation.
Mr. Pike<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c017'><sup>[604]</sup></a> has shown how, in Richard’s reign, barons were
not amerced with the common herd: at an eyre held at
Hertford in 1198-9, a list of those amerced was drawn
up and definite sums were entered after each name, with
two exceptions, Gerald de Furnivall and Reginald de Argenton,
each of whom was reserved for special treatment “as a
baron.” A local jury had evidently on the spot assessed the
amercements of villeins and ordinary freeholders (in exact
accordance with the rules of chapter 20); but the following
entry was made opposite each of the two barons’ names “to
be amerced <em>at the Exchequer</em> for a disseisin.” The Pipe
Roll of John’s first year shows that this was subsequently
done.<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c017'><sup>[605]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Magna Carta, then, had good precedents for insisting
that barons ought not to be amerced by the justices of
eyre in the course of their circuits; but what exactly did
it mean by demanding amercement "by their peers"?
Did this merely mean that a few peers, a few Crown
tenants, should be present at the exchequer when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>were amerced; or was it a demand for the assembling,
for that purpose, of a full <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commune concilium</i></span> like that
defined in chapter 14?</p>

<p class='c001'>The Crown, in the following reign, placed its own interpretation
on these words, and succeeded in turning into
a special disadvantage what the barons had insisted on as
a privilege. Bracton<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c017'><sup>[606]</sup></a> repeats this chapter verbatim, but
adds what seems to be an official gloss, qualifying it by
these words: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>et hoc per barones de scaccario vel coram ipso
rege</i></span>.” Barons, under this interpretation of Magna Carta,
had their amercements assessed neither by the whole body
of “their peers” in a full council, nor yet by a select jury
of those peers empannelled in the exchequer for that purpose,
but by royal officials, the barons of exchequer, or
the justices of King’s Bench. Thus the words of the
Charter were perverted by the ingenuity of the Crown
lawyers to authorize precisely what they had been originally
intended to forbid.<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c017'><sup>[607]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the fourteenth century several cases are recorded, in the
course of which defaulters, in the hope of escaping with
smaller payments, protested against being reckoned as
barons. For example, a certain Thomas de Furnivall in
the nineteenth year of Edward II. complained that he had
been amerced as a baron “to his great damage, and against
the law and custom of the realm,” whereas he really held
nothing by barony. The king directed the Treasurer and
Barons of the Exchequer “that if it appeared to them that
Thomas was not a baron, nor did hold his land by barony,
then they should discharge him of the said imposed amercement;
provided that Thomas should be amerced according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>to the tenor of the great Charter of Liberties,”<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c017'><sup>[608]</sup></a> that is to
say, as a simple freeholder according to the provisions of
chapter 20. It is clear that Thomas de Furnivall was
confident that a local jury would amerce him at a lower
figure than that fixed by the exchequer barons. A few
years earlier the Abbot of Croyland had made a similar
plea, but without success.<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c017'><sup>[609]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At a later date barons and earls were successful in
securing by another expedient some measure of immunity
from excessive exactions. They had established, prior to
the first year of Henry VI., a recognized scale of amercements
with which the Crown was expected, in ordinary
circumstances, to content itself.<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c017'><sup>[610]</sup></a> In the reign of Edward
IV. a duke was normally amerced at £10, and an earl or
a bishop at 100s.<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c017'><sup>[611]</sup></a></p>

church benefice.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Amercement of the clergy.</i> The churchman was to
receive the same favourable treatment as the layman in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>all respects, and to enjoy one additional privilege. In
proportioning the amercement to the extent of his wealth,
no account was to be taken of the value of his “church
benefice.” A sharp distinction is here drawn between <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>laicum
tenementum</i></span> (or, as the 10th of the Articles of the Barons
expressed it, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>laicum feodum</i></span>) and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>beneficium ecclesiasticum</i></span>.
This antithesis between “lay fee” and "alms"—that is,
between lands held by barony, knight’s service, or any
other secular tenure on the one hand, and lands held by
frankalmoin on the other—was a familiar one in the
Middle Ages.<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c017'><sup>[612]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Only the former was to be reckoned in fixing the defaulting
clerk’s amercement. This would leave the bishop
or abbot exposed to a higher payment proportionate to his
barony, while exempting the parish priest from any assessment
on account of his rectory and glebe. It would
almost seem that in the normal case the incumbent with
no wealth but the produce and rents of his benefice would
thus escape from amercement altogether; yet, if he had
no lay tenement, he might still have chattels, or might at
least pay instalments from the annual increase of his
crops. This exemption in favour of those who held lands
in “alms” may have proceeded from several possible
motives. Frankalmoin enjoyed many privileges, including,
in the reign of Henry II., complete immunity from
the jurisdiction of all secular courts.<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c017'><sup>[613]</sup></a> Perhaps the
Exchequer did not dare to levy contributions upon
such lands. In any view, it would have been manifestly
unjust to treat the clerical incumbent as though
he were the owner in fee simple of the church’s
patrimony.</p>

<p class='c001'>The word “clerk” was a wide one, including not only
the ordinary parish priests (whether rectors or vicars) with
the deacons and those who had taken minor orders, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>also the monks and canons regular (whose vows of poverty,
however, left no loophole for the legal retention by them
of private property which could require protection). It
included also the higher clergy, great prelates, bishops and
abbots, whose status was, however, complicated by their
ownership of Crown lands. Their character of “baron”
was often more prominent in constitutional questions than
that of “clerk in holy orders.” Their treatment in the
matter of amercements is a case in point.<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c017'><sup>[614]</sup></a> There could
have been no doubt from the first that a bishop “in
mercy” must submit to have his barony taken into consideration
in fixing his amercement. It would almost seem
that the great prelates were not intended to benefit in
any way from this exemption. Such is the suggestion
conveyed by a slight alteration effected in the Charter of
1217, which substitutes for the wider “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>clericus</i></span>” of the
text the more restricted expression "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ecclesiastica persona</i></span>"—words
which in the thirteenth century denoted the
parish clergy, and were used much as is the word “parson”
in colloquial speech at the present day.</p>

<p class='c001'>A certain looseness in the arrangement of the Latin
words of this chapter, as it originally stood in 1215, seems
to have suggested the need for improvement. Alterations,
apparently of a verbal nature, were made with some
evidences of care in Henry’s reissues. The “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de laico tenemento</i></span>”
of 1215 was omitted altogether in 1216; but a
reference to the “lay fees” of the clergy was reintroduced
in 1217, subject to a complete reconstruction of
the sentence to make it read smoothly, and so avoid
the possibility of misconception.<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c017'><sup>[615]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>No community or individual<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c017'><sup>[616]</sup></a> shall be compelled to make
bridges at river banks, except those who from of old were
legally bound to do so.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The object of this chapter is obvious; to compel the
king to desist from his practice of illegally increasing the
extent of an obligation—admitted as perfectly legal within
the limits defined by ancient usage—the obligation to keep
in good repair all existing bridges over rivers. John might
continue to exact what his ancestors had exacted; but
nothing more. So much lies on the surface of the Charter,
which explains, however, neither the origin of the obligation
nor the reasons which made John keen to enforce it.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Origin of the Obligation to make Bridges.</i> The
Norman kings seem to have based their claim to compel
their subjects to maintain such bridges as were necessary,
upon an ancient threefold obligation,<a href='#f616' class='c017'><sup>[616]</sup></a> (known as the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>trinoda
necessitas</i></span>) incumbent on all freemen during the Anglo-Saxon
period. Three duties were<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c017'><sup>[617]</sup></a> required of all the
men of England in the interests of the commonweal:
attendance on the fyrd or local militia; the making of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>roads, so necessary for military purposes; and the repairing
of bridges and fortifications. Gradually, as feudal
tendencies prevailed, the obligation to construct bridges
ceased to be a personal burden upon all freemen, and
became a territorial burden attached to certain manors
or freeholders. In other words, it was made a part of the
services incidental to the feudal tenure of particular estates.
The present chapter, in forbidding the illegal extension of
this burden to communities or individuals other than those
who rendered it as part of the services due for their
lands, seems to be only a particular application of the
general principle enunciated in chapter 16. The evil
complained of, however, required special treatment because
of the prominence into which it had been forced by John,
who had abused powers vested in his ancestors for national
purposes, in order to further his own selfish pleasures, in
a manner so well known to his contemporaries as not to
require specification in Magna Carta.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>The King’s interest in the Repair of Bridges.</i> John’s
motives for making an oppressive use of this prerogative
must be sought in a somewhat unexpected quarter, in
the king’s rights of falconry, and in his frequent need
for ready means of crossing rivers in pursuit of his valuable
birds of prey. Whenever John proposed to ride a-fowling,
with his hawk upon his wrist, he issued letters compelling
the whole country-side to bestir themselves in the repair
of bridges in every district which his capricious pleasure
might lead him to visit. Several such writs of the
reign of Henry III. are still extant. The exact words of
these vary somewhat, but a comparison of their terms
leaves no room for doubt either as to the nature of the
commands they conveyed or the reasons for issuing them.
Addressed to the sheriffs of such counties as the king
was likely to visit, at a convenient interval beforehand,
these letters gave instructions that all necessary steps
should be taken in preparation for the king’s hawking.
The writs contained two commands, an order for the
repair of bridges, and a prohibition against the taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>of birds before the king had enjoyed his sport. Both
points are well brought out in a Letter Close of Henry
III., dated 26th December, 1234, which directed "all
bridges on the rivers Avon, Test, and Itchen to be repaired
as was wont in the time of King John, so that when
the lord King may come to these parts, free transit shall
lie open to him for “riviating” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad riviandum</i></span>) upon the
said rivers." The writ then proceeded to command the
sheriff to issue a general prohibition against any one
attempting “to riviate” along the river banks, previous
to the coming of the king (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ne aliquis riviare praesumat
per riparias illas antequam rex illic venerit</i></span>”).<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c017'><sup>[618]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Latin verb, for which “to riviate” has been coined
as an English equivalent, has long been the subject of
misconception; but conclusive evidence has recently been
adduced to prove that it referred to the medieval sport
of fowling, that is to the taking of wild birds in sport
by means of hawks and falcons.<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c017'><sup>[619]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These writs prove that the Crown claimed and exercised
a monopoly of, or at least a preferential right to, this form
of sport along the banks of certain rivers; and these “preserved”
rivers were accordingly said to be placed “in
defence” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in defenso</i></span>), a phrase which occurs in many of
the writs referred to, as well as in a later chapter of
Magna Carta.<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c017'><sup>[620]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Two distinct hardships were thus imposed on the nation
by the king’s exercise of his rights of falconry, one negative
and the other positive. In the interval between the king’s
intimation and his arrival at the indicated rivers, the
sport of all other people was interfered with, while the
obligation to reconstruct otherwise useless bridges was a
more material burden on every village and individual
exposed to it. A wise king would be careful to use such
rights so as to inflict on his subjects a minimum of hardship.
John, however, knew no moderation, placing “in
defence” not merely a few banks at a time, but many
rivers indiscriminately, including those which had never
been so treated in his father’s day, and demanding that
all bridges everywhere should be repaired, with the object,
not so much of indulging a genuine love of sport, as of
inflicting heavy amercements on those who neglected
prompt obedience to his commands. Great consternation
was aroused by John’s action at Bristol in 1209 when
he prohibited the taking of birds throughout the entire
realm of England.<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c017'><sup>[621]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Both of these grievances, thus augmented by the policy
of King John, were redressed by Magna Carta, though
in different clauses. In the present chapter John promised
not to impose the burden of repairing bridges on those from
whom it was not legally due.<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c017'><sup>[622]</sup></a> Chapter 47, in which he
agreed to withdraw his interdict from all rivers which
he had placed “in defence” during his own reign, and
also to disafforest all forests of his own creation, was
entirely omitted in the Charter of 1216;<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c017'><sup>[623]</sup></a> but in 1217
it reappeared in a new position and expressed in different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>words. The provision of the original chapter 47, relating
to forests, was relegated to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Carta de Foresta</cite></span>, then
granted for the first time, and the other part of that
chapter, relating to falconry, was naturally enough joined
to a clause which redressed another grievance growing
from the same root. Chapter 19 of Henry III.’s Charter,
in its final form, repeats word for word the terms of the
present chapter of John, while in chapter 20 Henry proceeds
to declare “that no river shall in future be placed
in defence except such as were in defence in the time
of King Henry, our grandfather, throughout the same
places and during the same periods as they were wont
in his day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This express prohibition seems to have prevented the
Crown from extending its prerogatives any further in this
direction. Yet Henry III. had ample opportunities of
harassing his subjects by an inconsiderate use of the rights
still left to him. By issuing wholesale orders affecting
every preserved river which he had an admitted right to
put “in defence,” he might inflict widespread and wanton
hardships. In many cases dubiety existed on the question
of fact as to what banks had actually been “defended”
by Henry II., and a vague general command which named
no special rivers left in cruel uncertainty the district
to be visited. Henry III., accordingly, either yielding to
pressure or in return for grants of money, made important
concessions. After the year 1241, he invariably
specified the particular river along whose banks he intended
to sport, and sometimes even announced the exact date
at which he expected to arrive. As no writs appear
subsequent to 1247, it is possible that he was induced to
abstain altogether from the exercise of a right which
inflicted hardships on the people out of all proportion to
the benefits conferred on the king.<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c017'><sup>[624]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Crown, however, had not renounced its prerogatives,
and several writs still exist to show that Edward I.
occasionally allowed his great nobles to share in the royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>sport. Licences to this effect were granted in 1283 to
the Earl of Hereford and to Reginald fitz Peter, and in
the following year to the Earl of Lincoln. On 6th October,
1373, Edward III. by his writ commanded the sheriff of
Oxfordshire to declare that all bridges should be repaired
and all fords marked out with stakes for the crossing
of the king “with his falcons” during the approaching
winter season.<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c017'><sup>[625]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>Erroneous Interpretations.</i> There is nothing astonishing
in the fact that a pastime so passionately followed as
falconry was in the Middle Ages, should have left its traces
on two chapters of Magna Carta, the full import of which
has not hitherto been appreciated by commentators, partly
from failure to bring both of them together, but chiefly
because of the too precipitate assumption that the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad
riviandum</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in defenso</i></span>, occurring in writs and charters,
referred to <em>fishing</em> rather than to fowling.<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c017'><sup>[626]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It has been confidently inferred that the framers of
Magna Carta when forbidding additional banks to be put
“in defence,” equally as when demanding the removal of
“weirs” from non-tidal waters,<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c017'><sup>[627]</sup></a> were influenced by a desire
to preserve public rights of fishing against encroachment
by the king or by private owners. In either case the
motives were entirely different. In the Middle Ages, fishing
was a means of procuring food, not a form of sport: to
depict John and his action-loving courtiers as exponents of
the gentle art of Isaac Walton is a ridiculous anachronism.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is quite true that the value of fish as an article of
diet led in time to legislation directed primarily to their
protection; but apparently no statute with such a motive
was passed previous to 1285.<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c017'><sup>[628]</sup></a> It is further true that
in the reign of Edward I. it became usual to describe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>rivers, over which exclusive rights of fishing had been
established by riparian owners, as being <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in defenso</i></span>;<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c017'><sup>[629]</sup></a> but
rivers might be “preserved” for more purposes than one.
From Edward’s reign onwards, however, rights of fishing
steadily became more valuable, while falconry was superseded
by other pastimes. Accordingly a new meaning was
sought for provisions of Magna Carta whose original motive
had been forgotten. So early as the year 1283 the words
of a petition to the king in Parliament show that “fishing”
had been substituted for “hawking” in interpreting the
prohibition referred to in chapter 47 of John’s Charter.
In that year the men of York complained that Earl
Richard had interfered with their rights of fishing by
placing <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in defenso</i></span> the rivers Ouse and Yore, a proceeding
they declared to be “against the tenor of Magna Carta.”<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c017'><sup>[630]</sup></a>
This error, the first appearance of which thus dates from
1283, has been accepted for upwards of five hundred years
by all commentators on Magna Carta. The credit for dispelling
it is due to Mr. Stuart A. Moore and Mr. H. S.
Moore in their <cite>History and Law of Fisheries</cite>, published in
1903.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Pleas of the Crown.</i> All litigations tended to be
distinguished into two kinds, royal pleas and common pleas,
according as the interests of the Crown were or were not
specially involved. This classification has already been
discussed in connection with chapter 17, which sought to
regulate the procedure in common pleas. The present
chapter concerns itself only with “pleas of the Crown,”
a phrase which had even in 1215 considerably altered
its original meaning. In the eleventh century it had
denoted all royal business, whether specially relating to
legal procedure or not, embracing all matters connected
with the king’s household or his estates, with the collection
of his revenue, or the administration of his justice, civil as
well as criminal. Gradually, however, the usage of the
word altered in two respects, contracting in one direction,
while expanding in another. It ceased to be applied to
financial business and even to non-criminal, judicial business;
and it was thereafter reserved for criminal trials
held before the king’s judges. This process of contraction
had been nearly completed before the accession of John.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another tendency, however, in an opposite direction had
been for some time in progress; the distinction drawn in
early reigns between petty trespasses, which were left in
the province of the sheriff, and grave offences, which alone
were worthy of the king’s attention, was being slowly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>obliterated.<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c017'><sup>[631]</sup></a> The royal courts steadily extended the sphere
of their activity over all misdeeds, however trivial, until the
whole realm of criminal law fell under the description of
“pleas of the Crown.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the reign of John this process of expansion was far
from complete: the words then, indeed, embraced grave
criminal offences tried in the king’s courts, but not the
numerous petty offences, which were still disposed of in the
sheriffs tourn or elsewhere.<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c017'><sup>[632]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>North of the Tweed the same phrase has had a completely
different history: in modern Scots law its
connotation is still a narrow one; and this is a direct
result of the slow growth of the Scottish Crown in
authority and jurisdiction, in notable contrast to the
rapidity with which the English Crown attained the
zenith of its power. The kings of Scotland failed to
crush their powerful and unruly vassals, and consequently
the pleas of the Scottish Crown, exclusively reserved for
the High Court of Justiciary, formed a meagre list—the
four heinous crimes of murder, robbery, rape, and
arson. The feudal courts of the Scottish nobles long
preserved their wide jurisdiction over all other offences.
When the heritable jurisdictions were at last abolished,
in 1748, mainly as a consequence of the rebellion of three
years previously, the old distinction, so deeply rooted in
Scots law, still remained. The sheriff court had no cognizance,
until late in the nineteenth century, over the four
crimes specially reserved for the king’s judges.<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c017'><sup>[633]</sup></a> Thus in
Scotland the historic phrase “pleas of the Crown” is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>even at the present day, confined to murder, robbery,
rape, and fire-raising, while to an English lawyer it
embraces the entire realm of criminal law.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Keeping and Trying Criminal Pleas.</i> The machinery
for bringing criminals to justice, as organized by
Henry II., was somewhat elaborate. For our present purpose,
it may be sufficient to emphasize two important stages
in the procedure. An interval had always to elapse
between the commission of a grave crime and the formal
trial of the criminal, since it was necessary to wait for the
coming of the itinerant justices, which only took place at
intervals of about seven years. Meanwhile, preliminary
steps must be taken to collect and record evidence of
offences, which might otherwise be lost. The magistrate
responsible for these preliminary steps was said to “keep”
the pleas (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>custodire placita</i></span>)—that is, to watch them or
prevent them from passing out of mind while waiting
the coming of the justices who would formally “hold”
or “try” or “determine” the same pleas (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>placitare</i></span> or
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>habere</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tenere placita</i></span>).</p>

<p class='c001'>Before the reign of John, not only had the fundamental
distinction between these two stages of procedure been
clearly grasped, but the two functions had been entrusted
to two distinct types of royal officials. The local magistrates
of each district “kept” royal pleas, while only the
justices who represented the central government could
“hold” them. The process of differentiation was accelerated
towards the close of the twelfth century in consequence
of the jealousy with which the Crown regarded
the increasing independence of the sheriffs. The elaborate
instructions issued in 1194 to the justices whom Archbishop
Hubert Walter was despatching on a more than
usually important visitation of the counties contain two
provisions intended to keep the growing pretensions of
the sheriffs within due bounds.<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c017'><sup>[634]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>They were expressly forbidden to act as justices within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>their own counties, or, indeed, in any counties in which
they had acted as sheriffs at any time since Richard’s
coronation.<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c017'><sup>[635]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is safe to infer that the “trying” of royal pleas
was the province from which in particular the sheriff
was thus excluded. Even with regard to the “keeping”
or preliminary stages of such pleas the sheriff was by
no means left in sole command. The justices received
instructions<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c017'><sup>[636]</sup></a> to cause three knights and one clerk to be
chosen in each county as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>custodes placitorum coronae</i></span>.” It
is possible that these new local officers, specially entrusted
with the duty of “keeping” royal pleas, were intended
rather to co-operate with than to supersede the sheriffs in
this function, but in any view the sheriffs had no longer a
monopoly of authority in their bailiwicks. Magistrates, to
be afterwards known as coroners, were thenceforward associated
with them in the administration of the county.<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c017'><sup>[637]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The ordinance of 1194 seems to have settled subsequent
practice in both respects. Sheriffs, while still free to
punish petty offenders on their own authority, in their
half-yearly tourns or circuits, allowed the coroners to “keep”
royal pleas, and the justices to “try” them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Public opinion of the day strongly approved both rules,
yet John condoned and encouraged irregularities, allowing
sheriffs to meddle with pleas of the Crown, even when the
coroners were not present to check their arbitrary methods;<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c017'><sup>[638]</sup></a>
and allowing them to give a final judgment on such pleas,
involving, mayhap, loss of life or limb to those found
guilty, without waiting the arrival of the Justices.<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c017'><sup>[639]</sup></a> Such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>deviations from the normal course of procedure could be
no longer tolerated. Magna Carta accordingly, in this
first of a series of chapters directed against the misdeeds
of sheriffs and other local magistrates, forbade them to
interfere in this province.</p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>The Intention of Magna Carta.</i> The barons, in
this matter as in so many others, were merely demanding
that the Crown should observe strictly and impartially the
rules which it had laid down for its own guidance: caprice
must give way to law. Sheriffs must not, with or without
the king’s connivance, usurp the functions of coroners;
nor must sheriffs and coroners together usurp those of
the king’s justiciars. The opposition leaders naturally
associated these two irregularities together, and may even
have assumed that expressly to abolish the one implied,
with sufficient clearness, an intention to abolish the other
also. Such a supposition would explain a peculiar discrepancy
between the Articles and the Charter, in its
final form, which it is otherwise difficult to account for.
While Article 14 demanded redress of one specific grievance,
Magna Carta granted redress of an entirely different one.
The earlier document, neglecting the distinction between
“keeping” and “trying” pleas, simply requires that coroners
(whose comparative popularity is explained by their
appointment in the county court) should always be associated
with the sheriff when he meddles in any way with pleas of
the Crown. The Charter is silent on this subject; but
forbids sheriffs and coroners, whether acting separately or
together, to “try” or finally determine pleas of this description.
These two provisions are the complements of each
other. Magna Carta would thus seem to be here incomplete.</p>

<p class='c001'>The prohibition against sheriffs trying pleas of the Crown
was repeated in all reissues of the Charter; and, although
not perhaps strictly enforced in Henry’s reign, soon became
absolute. Under Edward I. it was interpreted to mean
that no one could determine such pleas unless armed with
a royal commission to that effect;<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c017'><sup>[640]</sup></a> and the commission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>would take the form either of gaol delivery, of trailbaston,
or of oyer and terminer.<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c017'><sup>[641]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>IV. <i>An Erroneous View.</i> Hallam seems to have misunderstood
the object aimed at by this provision. Commenting
on the corresponding chapter of Henry’s Charter of
1225, he declares that the “criminal jurisdiction of the
Sheriff is entirely taken away by Magna Charta, c. 17.”<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c017'><sup>[642]</sup></a>
This is a complete mistake: both before and after the
granting of the Charter, the sheriff exercised criminal jurisdiction,
and that of two distinct kinds. Along with the
coroners, he conducted preliminary enquiries even into pleas
of the Crown; while in his tourn (which was specially
authorized to be held twice a year by chapter 42 of the
very Charter quoted by Hallam) he was completely responsible
for every stage of procedure in regard to trivial
offences. He heard indictments and then tried and punished
petty offenders in a summary manner.<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c017'><sup>[643]</sup></a> Several statutes of
later reigns confirmed, even while regulating, the authority
of the sheriff to take indictments at his tourns,<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c017'><sup>[644]</sup></a> until this
jurisdiction was transferred, by an act of the fifteenth century,
to the justices of peace assembled in Quarter Sessions.<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c017'><sup>[645]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>All that Magna Carta did was to insist that no sheriff or
local magistrate should encroach on the province reserved
for the royal justices, namely the final “trying” of such
grave crimes as had now come to be recognized as “pleas of
the Crown.”<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c017'><sup>[646]</sup></a> The Charter did not even attempt to define
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>what these were, leaving the boundary between great and
small offences to be settled by use and wont. In all this,
it was simply declaratory of existing practice, making no
attempt to draw the line in a new place.<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c017'><sup>[647]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>V. <i>Local Magistrates under John.</i> The urgent need of
preventing the petty tyrants who controlled the administration
of the various districts from exercising jurisdiction
over the lives and limbs of freemen can be abundantly
illustrated from the details furnished by contemporary
records of the ingenious and cruel oppressions they constantly
resorted to. Ineffectual attempts had indeed been
made more than once to restrain their evil practices, as in
August, 1213, when directions were issued from the Council
of St. Alban’s commanding the sheriffs, foresters, and
others, to abstain from unjust dealing,<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c017'><sup>[648]</sup></a> and, again, some two
months later, when John, at the instance of Nicholas of
Tusculum, the papal legate, promised to restrain their
violence and illegal exactions.<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c017'><sup>[649]</sup></a> Little or nothing, however,
was effected in the way of reform; and Magna Carta, in
addition to condemning certain specified evils, contained
two general provisions, namely, chapter 45, which indicated
what type of men should be appointed as Crown officials,
and the present chapter, which forbade local magistrates to
encroach on the province of the king’s justices. These
local magistrates are comprehensively described under four
different names.<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c017'><sup>[650]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>(1) <i>The sheriff.</i> No royal officer was better or more
justly hated than the sheriff. The chapter under discussion
affords strong evidence alike of his importance and of the
jealousy with which his power was viewed. The very
briefest sketch of the origin and growth of the office is all
that is here possible. Long before the Conquest, in each
shire of England, the interests, financial and otherwise, of
the kings of the royal house of Wessex had been entrusted
to an agent or man of business of their own appointing,
known as a <i>scir-gerefa</i> (or shire-reeve). These officers were
continued by the Norman monarchs with increased powers
under the new name of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice comites</i></span>.<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c017'><sup>[651]</sup></a> It is an illustration of
the tenacity of the Anglo-Saxon customs and names that
this Latin title never took root, whereas the old title of
sheriff continues to the present day.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is true that in England during the Anglo-Saxon period
the chief power over each shire or group of shires had been
shared among three officers—the bishop, the earl, and the
sheriff. The bishop, by the natural differentiation of
functions, soon confined his labours to the spiritual affairs
of his diocese; while the deliberate policy of the Conqueror
and his successors relegated the earl to a position of dignity
altogether severed from the possession of real power. Thus
the sheriff was left without a rival within his shire. For a
period of at least one hundred years after the Norman Conquest
he wielded an excessive local authority as the sole
tyrant of the county. He was not indeed irresponsible, but
it was difficult for his victims to obtain the ear of the distant
king, who alone was strong enough to punish him. The
zenith of the sheriff’s power, however, was passed in the
twelfth century, and before its close changes had been introduced
with the view of checking his abuses. Henry II.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>frequently punished his sheriffs for their misdeeds, and
removed them from office.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has already been explained how in 1194 the sheriff’s
powers were further restricted, while new officers were
appointed in each county to share the authority still left to
him. To the very next year (1195) is usually traced the
origin of the justices of the peace, who gradually took over
the chief duties of the sheriff until they had practically
superseded him as the ruling power in the county. In
Tudor days a new rival appeared in the Lord Lieutenant,
then first appointed in each shire to represent the Crown in
its military capacity, and particularly to take over command
of the militia of the county. The fall of the sheriff from
his former high estate was thus gradual, although finally
most complete. From presiding, as he did in his golden age,
over all the business of the district—financial, administrative,
military, and judicial—the sheriff has become, in England at
the present day, a mere honorary figure-head of the county
executive. A high sheriff is still chosen annually by King
Edward for each county by <a id='corr367.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='pricking'>picking</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_367.20'><ins class='correction' title='pricking'>picking</ins></a></span> at random one name
out of a list of three leading land-owners presented to him
for that purpose by the judges. The gentleman on whom
this sometimes unwelcome dignity is thrust is still nominally
responsible during his year of office for the execution of all
writs of the superior Courts within his county, for returning
the names of those elected to serve in the House of Commons,
and for many other purposes; but his responsibility is
chiefly theoretical. All the real duties of his office are now
performed in practice by subordinates. What really remains
to him is an empty and expensive honour, usually shunned
rather than courted. In Scotland and America the sheriff
also exists at the present day, but his position and functions
have in these countries developed in very different directions.
In Scotland, in opposition to what has happened in
England and America, the sheriff has remained emphatically
a judicial officer, the judge of an inferior court, namely, the
local court of his shire, known as “the Sheriff Court.” He
has thus retained intact his judicial functions, to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>such nominal administrative duties as still remain to him
are entirely subordinate. In the United States of America,
on the contrary, the sheriff is a purely executive official,
possessing perhaps more real power, but notably less honour
and social distinction than fall to the lot of the English high
sheriff. The duties of his office are sometimes performed
by him in person; he may even set out at the head of the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>posse comitatus</i></span> in pursuit of criminals. Three completely
different offices have thus sprung from the same constitutional
root, and all three are still known by one name in England,
Scotland, and America respectively.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>The constable.</i> Portions of certain counties were
exempted, partially or entirely, from the sheriff’s bailiwick,
and placed under the authority of specially appointed
magistrates. Thus districts afforested were administered
by forest wardens assisted by verderers who excluded the
sheriffs and coroners; while royal fortresses, together with
the land immediately surrounding them, were under the
sole command of officers known indifferently as castellans
or constables.<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c017'><sup>[652]</sup></a> The offices of warden of a particular forest
and warden of an adjacent royal castle were frequently
conferred on the same individual. Indeed, chapter 16 of
the Forest Charter of Henry III. seems to use the term
“castellans” as the recognized name of forest wardens,
whom it forbids to hold “pleas of the forest,” although
they may attach or “keep” them (with the co-operation
of the verderers), and present them for trial before the
king’s emissaries when next sent to hold a forest eyre—thus
offering a complete parallel between procedure at
“forest pleas” and that prescribed by the present chapter
for ordinary pleas of the Crown.<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c017'><sup>[653]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The name constable is an ambiguous one, since it has
at different periods of history been applied to officers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>extremely different types. The king’s High Constable, a
descendant of the horse-thegn of the Anglo-Saxon kings,
was originally that member of the royal household who
was specially responsible for the king’s stables. At a
later date, he shared with the Earl Marshal the duties
of Commander-in-chief of the king’s armies. The name
of constable was also used in a wider sense to designate
other and subordinate royal ministers. It came to be
applied to commanders of small bodies of troops, whether
in castles or elsewhere. At a later date the word lost its
warlike associations, and was used in connection with the
duties of watch and ward. A constable was a person
specially entrusted with enforcing order in his own locality.
Thus each hundred had its high constable and each village
its petty constable in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c017'><sup>[654]</sup></a>
These various officials were thus, at different dates, all
designated by a name usually, at the present day, confined
to ordinary members of the police force.</p>

<p class='c001'>The word as used in Magna Carta had not yet lost
its military character, but denoted the castellan who
commanded the troops which garrisoned a royal castle.<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c017'><sup>[655]</sup></a>
Such an office was one of great trust; and correspondingly
wide powers were conferred upon its holder. The warden
of a castle held an important military command, and acted
as gaoler of the prisoners confided to the safe-keeping of
his dungeons. He had authority, under certain ill-defined
restrictions, to take whatever he thought necessary
for provisioning the garrison—a privilege, the exercise of
which frequently led to abuses, guarded against by chapters
28 and 29 of Magna Carta, where they are discussed
under the head of purveyance. He had also, to a limited
extent, judicial authority. Not only did he try pleas for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>small debts to which Jews were parties, but he enjoyed
a jurisdiction over all petty offences committed within the
precincts of the castle, analogous to that of the sheriff
within the rest of the county. This power of trying and
punishing misdemeanours was not taken away by the
Great Charter, and was confirmed by implication in 1300
by a statute which directed that the constable of Dover
Castle should not hold within the castle gate “foreign”
pleas of the county which did not affect “the guard of
the castle.”<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c017'><sup>[656]</sup></a> It is not known at what date the judicial
powers of constables fell into disuse; but they still acted
as gaolers at a much later period. In the reign of Henry
IV. complaint was made that constables of castles were
appointed justices of the peace, and imprisoned in one
capacity the victims whom they had unjustly condemned
in another. This practice was put down by statute
in 1403.<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c017'><sup>[657]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It would seem that at an earlier period the constable
sometimes acted as a deputy-sheriff. Chapter 12 of the
Assize of Northampton provided that when the sheriff was
absent the nearest <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>castellanus</i></span> might take his place in
dealing with a thief who had been arrested. His interference
outside his own precincts must, however, have been
regarded with great jealousy, and the coroners, after their
appointment in 1194, would naturally act as substitutes
during the sheriff’s absence.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <i>The coroners.</i> The coroners of each county, after
their institution in 1194, seem to have shared with the
sheriff most of the powers of which the latter had previously
enjoyed a monopoly. The nature of their duties is
explained by the oath of office sworn in the same words
for many centuries, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad custodienda ea quae pertinent ad
coronam</i></span>.” Their duty was to guard royal interests
generally; and their “keeping” of royal pleas was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>merely one aspect of this wider function. Besides “attaching”
those suspected of crimes—that is, receiving formal
accusations and taking such sureties as might be necessary,
it was their duty to make all such preliminary investigations
as might throw light on the case when the formal
trial was afterwards held; they had, for example, to
examine the size and nature of the victim’s wounds in
a charge of mayhem.<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c017'><sup>[658]</sup></a> They were required, in particular,
to keep a watchful eye on all royal property, being responsible
for the safe-keeping of deodands, wrecks, and treasure
trove. They had also to appraise the value of all chattels
of criminals forfeited to the king. When felons took
refuge in sanctuary, it was the coroner who arranged for
their leaving the country on forfeiting all that they had.
They also kept a record of those who had been outlawed,
and received “appeals” or private accusations of criminal
charges.<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c017'><sup>[659]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Magna Carta forbade the coroner to determine the
pleas of the Crown; but, even after 1215, he sometimes
did justice upon felons caught red-handed, whose guilt was
self-evident without trial. An act of Edward I.<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c017'><sup>[660]</sup></a> accurately
defined his duties, empowering him to attach pleas of
the Crown and to present criminals to the justices for
trial, but forbidding him to proceed further alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>The coroner’s functions, originally so wide and varied,
have been gradually narrowed down, until now there is
practically only one duty commonly associated with his
office, namely, the holding of an inquest on a dead body
where there are suspicious circumstances.<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c017'><sup>[661]</sup></a> In addition
to this, however, he is still responsible for treasure-trove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>or valuables found buried in the ground, and he is also
competent to act generally as the substitute of the sheriff
in case of the latter’s illness or absence during his year
of office.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <i>The bailiffs.</i> The mention by name of three classes
of local officers is supplemented by the addition of an
indefinite word sufficiently wide to cover all grades of
Crown officials. The term “bailiff” may be correctly
applied to every individual to whom authority of any sort
has been delegated by another. It would, in the present
instance, include the assistants of sheriffs and constables,
the men who actually served writs, or distrained the goods
of debtors; and also generally all local officials of every
description holding authority directly or indirectly from the
Crown. The district over which his office extended was
called his “bailiwick,” a term often applied to the county
considered as the sphere of the sheriff’s labours.</p>

sheriff’s irregularities had certainly no intention to enhance the royal
power. The attitude of the insurgents in 1215 suggests rather that the
sheriffs had now become instruments of royal absolutism to a greater extent
than the king’s justices themselves. The problem of local government
had thus assumed a new form (cf. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>supra</i></span>, p. 20). Edward I., indeed, deftly

<div class='translate'>

<p class='c001'>All counties, hundreds, wapentakes, and trithings (except
our demesne manors) shall remain at the old rents, and
without any additional payment.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This provision also was directed against the sheriffs, and
shows a praiseworthy determination to get to the root of
the disease, instead of merely attacking the symptoms.
The rents at which the counties (or parts of them) were
farmed out to the sheriffs must no longer be arbitrarily
raised, but were to remain at the old figures which had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>become stereotyped from long usage. To understand how
such increases would injuriously affect the inhabitants of the
county, some explanation is necessary. Centuries before the
Norman Conquest, the long process had been already completed
by which England had been gradually mapped out
into shires on lines substantially the same as those which
still exist. Each county had been further subdivided into
smaller districts known as “hundreds” in the south, and as
“wapentakes” in the Danish districts of the north; while
intermediate divisions existed, exceptionally, in some of the
specially large counties such as York and Lincoln, each
of which had three “trithings” or ridings.</p>

<p class='c001'>In commenting upon chapter 24, it has been already
explained how the Anglo-Saxon kings entrusted their
interests in each shire to an officer called a sheriff, and how
a similar officer under the Norman kings became practically
the chief magistrate and local judge in the county. His
financial duties, however, long remained the most
important: William I. and his successors had greater
pecuniary interests in the English counties than their Anglo-Saxon
forerunners ever had, and the sheriffs were their
agents in collecting all rents and other dues. Even before
the Conquest, however, the sheriff of an ordinary county had
ceased to be a mere intermediary, who lifted the king’s
rents and paid over, pound by pound, the yearly varying
sums he might receive. He had become a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firmarius</i></span>: he
bought for a yearly rent the right to collect and appropriate
to his own uses the various revenues of the county. The
Crown got only the exact sum stipulated for, known as the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma comitatus</i></span>; while the balance, if any, remained with
the sheriff. That officer was liable, on the other hand,
for the sum agreed on, even when the annual yield fell
short of his anticipations. In plain words, the sheriff
speculated in the returns, and it was his business, by
fair means or foul, to make sure of a handsome surplus.</p>

<p class='c001'>Authorities differ as to the exact list of items purchased
by the slump sum known as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma comitatus</i></span>; but undoubtedly
the two chief sources of revenue embraced were the profits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>of justice dispensed in the local courts, and the rents
and returns from the various royal manors in the
county.</p>

<p class='c001'>William I. sharply raised the amounts of all these farms
for his own benefit, and his successors endeavoured, whenever
possible, to increase them still further. Now it might
seem at first sight that these additional burdens concerned
exclusively the Crown and the sheriff, but such was by no
means the case. The sheriff took care to pass on the burden
primarily falling upon him to the shoulders of those who were
subject to his authority. When the king exacted more
from the sheriff, the latter in turn increased the pressure on
the inhabitants of his county or group of counties. His
rule tended always to be oppressive, but his unjust fines and
exactions would be doubled at times when the amount of
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma</i></span> had recently been raised.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under the vigilant rule of Henry II. some measure of
relief was obtained by the shires from the misdeeds of
their local tyrants, since that far-seeing king knew that
his own best interests called for a curtailment of the
pretensions of the sheriffs. He punished their excesses,
and frequently deprived them of office. Under John the
sheriffs had a comparatively free hand to oppress their
victims, for he entered into a tacit alliance with them, in
order that the two tyrants (the heads of the central and
the local government respectively) might together fleece the
men of the county more effectually. In addition to the
fixed annual rents in name of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma</i></span> which had again
become stereotyped, John extorted an additional lump payment
called either an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>incrementum</i></span> or by various other
names, and allowed the sheriffs to inflict new severities
in order to recoup themselves for their additional outlay.<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c017'><sup>[662]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>Magna Carta made no attempt to abolish the practice of
farming out the shires, but forbade alike the increase of the
farm and the exaction of an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>incrementum</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this reform benefited the men of the counties in their
dealings with the sheriffs, it also gave the sheriffs an unfair
advantage over the exchequer. The total value of the
various assets included in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma comitatus</i></span> had greatly
increased in the past, and would probably continue to
increase in the future. Therefore, it was absurd to bind the
Crown by a hard-and-fast rule which would practically make
a present of this future “unearned increment” to the
sheriff. It belonged of right to the Crown; and the exchequer
had increasing need of supplies to meet the
increasing duties of the central government. To stereotype
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma</i></span> to be paid in return for a constantly increasing
revenue was unfair to the Crown.<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c017'><sup>[663]</sup></a> It is thus easy to
understand why this chapter was entirely omitted in 1216
and in subsequent reissues. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Articuli super cartas</cite></span>, on
the other hand, while conceding to the counties the right of
electing their own sheriffs, reaffirmed the principle of John’s
Charter, declaring that neither the bailiwicks and hundreds
of the king, nor those of great lords ought to be put to farm
at too high rates. The evil, however, continued under a
new form; sheriffs, while only paying a moderate farm themselves,
sublet parts of their province at much higher rates,
thus appropriating the increment denied to the exchequer,
while the bailiffs who had paid the increase could not “levy
the said ferm without doing extortion and duress to the
people.”<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c017'><sup>[664]</sup></a> Three successive acts prohibited this practice,
declaring that hundreds and wapentakes must either be kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>in the sheriff’s own hands, or sublet, if at all, at the old
fixed farms only.<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c017'><sup>[665]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One exception to the scope of its own provisions was
deliberately made by Magna Carta—an exception of an
important and notable nature; the demesne manors of
the Crown were deliberately left exposed to arbitrary
increases of their annual rents. The towns in this respect
were practically in the same position as the demesne manors.
It is true that many of them had received separate charters
fixing the amounts annually payable under the name of
farm (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma burgi</i></span> in their case), and that all such charters
received a general confirmation in chapter 13 of the
Great Charter, but the Crown could probably evade these
promises by applying the name of “increment” to any
additional payments desired, or, if that were objected to,
might still resort to an arbitrary “tallage,” the right to
extort which had not been taken away by Magna Carta.
The money was as good to the Crown under one name as
under another.<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c017'><sup>[666]</sup></a></p>

not by putting the ferm at a higher figure, but by charging the sheriff with
an additional lump sum under the title of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>crementum</i></span>, or, in John’s time,

by John. Henry II. often exacted such extra payments under the name
of ”<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gersuma</i></span>." Thus in <cite>Pipe Roll</cite> Henry II. (p. 11) the Sheriff of Norfolk
and Suffolk paid 200 marks under that name. The method adopted was

from him to us, all the chattels shall go to the deceased,
saving to his wife and children their reasonable shares.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The primary object of this chapter was to regulate the
procedure to be followed in attaching the personal estates of
Crown tenants who were also Crown debtors. Incidentally,
however, it throws light on the general question of the right
of bequeathing property.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>The Nature of the Grievance.</i> When a Crown tenant
died it was almost certain that arrears of one or other of
the numerous scutages, incidents, or other payments due to
the Crown remained unpaid. The sheriff and the bailiffs of
the district where the deceased’s estates lay were in the
habit of seizing everything they could find on his manor
under the excuse of securing the interests of their royal
master. They attached and sold chattels out of all proportion
to the sum actually due; and after satisfying the
Crown debt, a large surplus would often remain in the
sheriff’s hands which it would be exceedingly difficult for
the relatives of the deceased freeholder to force him to
disgorge.</p>

<p class='c001'>Magna Carta here sought to make such irregularities
impossible for the future by carefully defining the exact
procedure to be followed in such circumstances. The
sheriff and his bailiffs were forbidden to touch a single
chattel of a deceased Crown tenant, unless they came armed
with a legal warrant in the form of royal letters patent
vouching the existence and the amount of the Crown debt.
Even after exhibiting a warrant in proper form, the officers
were only allowed to attach as many chattels as could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>reasonably be considered necessary to satisfy the full value
of the debt due to the exchequer; and everything so taken
must be carefully inventoried. All this was to be done “at
the sight of lawful men,” respectable, if humble, neighbours
specially summoned for that purpose, whose function it was
to form a check on the actions of the sheriff’s officers generally,
to prevent them from appropriating anything not included
in the inventory, to assist in valuing each article and to see
that no more chattels were distrained than necessary. A
saving clause protected the interests of the Crown by forbidding
the removal from the tenant’s fief of any of the
chattels, even those not so attached, until the full ascertained
amount had actually been paid to the exchequer.
The Crown’s preferential claims remained over everything
on the manor until the debt was extinguished. Only after
that had been done, could a division of the estate take place
among the deceased man’s relatives or those in whose favour
he had executed a Will.</p>

<p class='c001'>These provisions should be read in connection with the
terms of chapter 9,<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c017'><sup>[668]</sup></a> which provided that diligence for Crown
debts must proceed against personal estate before the debtor’s
freehold was distrained, and laid down other equitable rules
applicable alike to the case of a deceased Crown debtor and
to that of a living one.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>The Right to Bequeath.</i> The main interest of this
chapter lies, however, for the historian of law and institutions,
in quite a different direction; to him it is valuable
for the light incidentally thrown on the limits within
which the right of making Wills was recognized in 1215.
The early law of England seems to have had great
difficulty in deciding how far it ought to acknowledge the
claims made by owners of property, both real and personal,
to direct its destination after death. Various influences
were at work, prior to the Norman Conquest, to make the
development of this branch of law illogical and capricious.<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c017'><sup>[669]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>Of the law of bequests in the twelfth century, however,
it is possible to speak with greater certainty; definite
principles had by that time received general recognition.
All testamentary rights over land or other real estate
(so far as these had ever actually existed) were now
abolished, not, as has sometimes been maintained, in the
interest of the feudal lord, but rather in the interests of the
expectant heir.<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c017'><sup>[670]</sup></a> Thus the right to devise land had been
absolutely prohibited before the end of the twelfth century.
Many reasons contributed to this result. For one thing, it
had become necessary to prevent churchmen from using
their influence to wring bequests of land from dying men, to
the impoverishment of the rightful heir, and to the
destruction of the due balance between Church and State,
already menaced by the rapidly accumulating wealth of the
various religious orders.</p>

<p class='c001'>Churchmen, in compensation as it were for the obstacles
thus opposed to their thirst for the land of the dying, made
good their claim to regulate all Wills dealing with personal
estate; that is money, goods, and chattels. They claimed
and obtained for their own courts the right to exclusive
jurisdiction over all testamentary provisions, now, of
course, competent in respect of personal estate only. The
Courts Christian “proved” Wills, (that is, usurped the
right to determine whether they were really valid acts of
the departed or not) and also superintended their administration.
In particular, they had control over the “executors”
who were originally the friends to whom the deceased had
made known his wishes as to the distribution of his money
and chattels on his death. The Church Courts ensured
that the executors loyally carried out these intentions,
and prevented them from appropriating to their own uses
what had been entrusted to them for the good of the
deceased’s soul. In John’s reign, however, the Crown and
its officers interfered alike with the rights of testators to
make Wills and the rights of the bishop of the diocese
to supervise the distribution. Not only did the sheriffs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>find pretexts to help themselves; but John seems to have
maintained that Wills were not valid without his consent,
which had, as usual, to be paid for. Such, at least, is the
inference to be drawn from the existence of writs granting
licences to make a Will, or confirming one that had been
made.<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c017'><sup>[671]</sup></a> The king’s interference in this province seems,
however, to have been regarded as an entirely illegal encroachment.</p>

<p class='c001'>In strict law, rights of testation, though prohibited <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quoad</i></span>
land, were recognized <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quoad</i></span> personal estate. It must not,
however, be supposed that the testator was at liberty to
divide or “devise” all his money and chattels. The reasonable
claims of wife and children must first be respected,
and only the free balance, after satisfying these, could be
distributed. It was long before any exact rule was
established for determining the amount of these “reasonable”
claims. Much could be said for an elastic rule which
allowed the proportion of personal estate falling to wife and
children to vary with the circumstances of each case; but
this vagueness had one grave objection; it inevitably led to
friction and family quarrels. Magna Carta in this respect
simply confirmed existing practice, and made no attempt at
definition. During the thirteenth century, however, the
lawful shares of wife and children were definitely fixed by
the English common law, and that, too, at exactly the same
proportions of the entire personal estate as are recognized to
the present day by the law of Scotland. Where a Scots
testator dies leaving wife and children, his moveable or
personal estate is regarded as falling naturally into three
equal parts, known as the widow’s part, the bairn’s part, and
the dead’s part, respectively. It is only with the last
mentioned third of his own moveables that he can do as he
likes. If he disposes of the rest, wife and children may
claim their legal rights and “break the Will.” Where a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>wife survives but no children, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>, the division is
into two equal portions. Magna Carta recognises a similar
threefold or twofold decision, and contains a clear acknowledgment
of what Scots law to the present day quaintly
describes as "the dead’s part." It was only the residue of
the deceased’s chattels after claims of wife and children had
been satisfied, which was “to fall to the deceased,” and
which is also spoken of as the portion of personal estate
left to the executors “to fulfil the testament of the
deceased.” This portion was appropriated “to the use of
the dead”: that is, his executors, under the guidance of the
Church Courts, would use it for the salvation of his soul.
The deceased might either have given specific directions, or
have left full powers to his executors (frequently churchmen)
to make the division for charitable and religious
purposes according to their own discretion. Part might go
to needy relations, or to the poor of the district; part to
endow religious houses; and part in masses for his eternal
welfare.</p>

<p class='c001'>Long subsequent to the thirteenth century, the laws of
England and Scotland as to the rights of succession of wife
and children seem to have remained identical: but, while
Scots law is the same to the present day, recognizing still
the widow’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jus relictae</i></span> and the children’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>legitim</i></span>, the English
law has, by slow steps, the details of which are obscure,
entirely changed. The rule which acknowledged the
children’s right to one third of the personal estate was
gradually relaxed, while the testator became sole judge
what provision he ought to make for his sons, until at last
a purely nominal sum of money was all that was required.
Finally the power to bequeath personal estate has (in sympathy
with exaggerated modern conceptions of the sacredness
of rights of “property”) expanded to such an extent
that a father may leave his children entirely penniless; and
the law will not interfere. The law of England, at the present
day, does not compel him to leave his son or daughter even
the proverbial shilling. The phrase “to cut off a son with
a shilling,” which still lives in popular usage, may possibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>perpetuate a now forgotten tradition of an intermediate
stage of English law, where some provision, however
inadequate, had to be made, if the Will was to be allowed
to stand.<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c017'><sup>[672]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Here the Great Charter proceeds to remedy an evil
connected with <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>intestate</i></span> succession, a natural sequel to the
subject of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>testate</i></span> succession. John was made to promise
that he would not seize, as forfeit to his exchequer,
the chattels of men who had neglected to make a will.
In the Middle Ages all classes of men, good and bad
alike, exhibited an extreme horror of dying intestate.<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c017'><sup>[673]</sup></a>
Several causes contributed towards this frame of mind.
Churchmen, from motives not unmixed, diligently inculcated
the belief that a dying man’s duty was to leave
part at least of his personal estate (the only property
over which the law allowed him powers of disposal) for
religious and charitable objects. The bishop or priest,
who had power to give or withhold extreme unction to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>the sinner who had confessed his sins, was in a peculiarly
strong position to enforce his advice upon men who believed
the Church to hold the keys of heaven. Thus, every man
on his death-bed had powerful motives for making his
will in such form as the Church approved. Motives of
a more worldly kind urged him in the same direction.
If he died intestate, a scramble for his personal effects
would undoubtedly result. Many powerful claimants were
ready to compete. In Glanvill’s day, for example,<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c017'><sup>[674]</sup></a> every
feudal lord claimed the goods of his intestate vassals.
Such demands were difficult to defeat, although Bracton,
at a later date<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c017'><sup>[675]</sup></a> declared them to be illegal, at least in
cases of sudden death. Then, the kinsmen—rich and poor
relations—had certain rights never very clearly defined.
The Church, too, stood ready, with claims judiciously
vague, which might be expanded as occasion required.
It arrogated, at the very lowest, the right to distribute
the dead man’s chattels for the good of his soul, and
there are instances when a strong-minded bishop or abbot
insisted on such a distribution, although the deceased had
died unrepentant, leaving no will.<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c017'><sup>[676]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Prelates allowed themselves liberal discretion in regard
to "the dead’s part" over which they thus assumed
control. Something might go to the poor, but much
would naturally be spent on masses for the departed soul,
while a portion might openly be retained as a recompense
for trouble expended in this pious cause. The
king was another competitor for the goods of those who
left no will; and attempts were made at various times
to treat intestacy, more especially in the case of clerks,
as a cause of forfeiture.<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c017'><sup>[677]</sup></a> For our present purpose it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>unnecessary to discuss whether this claim was founded
on the royal prerogative or on the rights of the king in
his capacity either as overlord or as patron of vacant
sees.<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c017'><sup>[678]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This chapter of Magna Carta was directed against all
such pretensions of the Crown or its officials. Whoever
else might get these windfalls, King John must not compete.
So much is clear; some sort of compromise was,
further, made between the two most likely claimants.
Magna Carta provided for a friendly co-operation between
the deceased’s kinsmen and the Church in distributing
the residue of the intestate’s personal estate, after satisfying
all preferential claims of creditors, wives, and children.
This chapter, although afterwards struck out of all reissues
of the Charter, seems to have been observed in practice.<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c017'><sup>[679]</sup></a>
Apparently, however, the right of the kinsfolk to share
the control with the Church gradually receded into the
background, while the Courts Christian assumed complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>authority in all cases of intestacy; so much so, that
churchmen had frequently to be reminded that they were
only the dead man’s administrators, and not entitled to
appropriate the goods to their own uses.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is easy to understand the motives which, in 1216,
led those responsible for the government of the young
Henry III. to withdraw this provision of Magna Carta. The
Crown had then need of all the money it could get, and
so long as the uncertainty of the law allowed a scramble
to take place for the goods of intestates, the king could
not be asked to stand aside with his hands tied by a
clause of Magna Carta. He would take his chance with
the other claimants. It was the Church, however, and
not the Crown, which finally secured the prize.<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c017'><sup>[680]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f678'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r678'>678</a>. Royal prerogatives in the twelfth century were still elastic and
undefined. Henry II. used them freely, but on the whole fairly. His
sons stretched every doubtful claim to its utmost limits. The Crown
was the legal heir of all Jews (cf. c. 10) and apparently of all Christian
usurers as well, at least of such as died unrepentant. (See Pollock
and Maitland, II. 486, and authorities there cited.) It is interesting
in this connection to note that the making of a will was looked on
as a necessary condition of a usurer’s repentance. (See <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dialogus de
Scaccario</cite></span>, 224–5, nn.) The king, further, took the goods of all who
died a felon’s death (cf. c. 32) and of men who committed suicide
(itself a felony). John, so we may infer from Magna Carta, went
further, and appropriated the chattels of all intestates. Were there any
precedents from his father’s reign for this wider claim? Madox (I. 346)
cites an entry from the <cite>Pipe Polls</cite> of 1172, recording 60 marks due
the exchequer as the value of the chattels of an intestate; and, two
years later, mention is made <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de pecunia Gilleberti qui obiit intestatus</i></span>.
There is nothing to show whether such men were, or were not, usurers.
The Pope was another competitor for the personal estates of intestate
clerks. In 1246, he issued an edict making this demand. Even Henry
III. (dependent and ally of Rome as he was) protested, and the edict
was withdrawn. (See Pollock and Maitland, II. 357.)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f679'>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f680'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r680'>680</a>. This chapter should be compared with a corresponding provision in
the Charter of Liberties granted by Henry I. William Rufus, like
John, had evidently helped himself freely to the chattels of intestates.
Henry I. (c. 7) made what seems to be merely a partial renunciation
of this right: where the deceased had been prevented “by arms or
infirmity” from making his will, his relations and vassals might distribute
his goods for him. Are we to infer that Henry reserved the
right to seize them in all other events? Stephen, in his second or
Oxford Charter (cf. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>supra</i></span>, p. 121 and appendix), clearly and unambiguously
resigned all such rights, as far as the property of churchmen was
concerned. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Si vero morte preoccupatus fuerit, pro salute anime ejus ecclesie
consilio eadem fiat distributio.</i></span> He also confirmed full rights of making wills
to churchmen. We have already seen that his successors did not observe
these provisions. (See <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>supra</i></span>, pp. 383-4, and also Pollock and Maitland,

</div>

<p class='c001'>This chapter is the first of several which redressed abuses
springing from one root, namely, the exercise of the royal
right of purveyance by the various agents of the local
government.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Purveyance in General.</i> The Norman and Angevin
kings of England were compelled by their administrative
duties and induced by the pleasures of the chase to move
their courts constantly from district to district. During
these royal progresses the difficulties must have been great
of finding sufficient food for the enormous retinues surrounding
the king in times of peace, and for his armed levies
in time of war. It was to the interests of the community
as a whole that the work of government and of national
defence should not be brought to a stand-still for want
of supplies. No opposition was made when the king
arrogated to himself the privilege of appropriating, under
fair conditions, such necessaries as his household might
require. Such a right, not unlike that enjoyed in modern
times by the commander of an army encamped in an
enemy’s country, was allowed to the kings of England in
their own land in times of peace, and was known as the
prerogative of purveyance.<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c017'><sup>[681]</sup></a> Unfortunately, the conditions
under which supplies might be requisitioned were left
vague: the privilege was therefore subject to constant
abuse. In theory it was always spoken of as merely a
right of pre-emption; the provisions seized were to be paid
for at the market rate: but practice tended to differ lamentably
from theory. In the absence of a neutral arbitrator
to fix the value of the goods, the unfortunate seller was
often thankful to accept any pittance offered by royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>officials, who might subsequently indeed charge a higher
rate against the Crown. Payment was often indefinitely
delayed or made not in coin but in exchequer tallies, “a
vexatious anticipation of taxation,” since these could only
be used in payment of Crown dues. What was worse, in
the hurry of the moment, the king’s purveyors often omitted
the formality of paying altogether.</p>

<p class='c001'>Magna Carta did not abolish purveyance, and placed no
restrictions whatever upon its use for the legitimate and
original purpose of supplying the king’s household. Some
slight attempt to control its exercise was made sixty years
later in the Statute of Westminster I.; but without producing
much effect.<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c017'><sup>[682]</sup></a> The grievances connected with purveyance
continued throughout four centuries as a fertile
source of vexation to the people and of friction between
parliament and the king. An attempt, made by the House
of Commons to induce James I. to surrender this prerogative
for a suitable money grant, ended in failure, with
the abandonment of the abortive treaty known as “the
Great Contract.” In the general re-settlement of the
revenue, however, at the Restoration, purveyance and pre-emption,
which had fallen into disuse during the Commonwealth,
were abolished.<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c017'><sup>[683]</sup></a> Yet in the following year a new
statute<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c017'><sup>[684]</sup></a> virtually revived one branch of the right under
essential modifications: when royal progresses were necessary
in the future, warrants might be issued from the
Board of Green Cloth, authorizing the king to use such
carts and carriages as he might require, at a fair rate
of hire specified in the Act of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Branches of Purveyance restricted by Magna Carta.</i> A
practice tolerated in spite of its burdensome nature because
of its absolute necessity, when confined to its original purpose
of providing for the needs of the king’s household,
became intolerable when claimed by every castle-warden,
sheriff, and local bailiff for his own personal or official
needs. The annoyance and hardships inseparable from such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>arbitrary interference with the rights of private property
were thus increased tenfold, while ample discretionary
authority was vested in a class of officials least qualified to
use it, unscrupulous foreign adventurers hired by John to
intimidate the native population, responsible to no one save
the king, and careful never to issue from their strongholds
except at the head of their reckless soldiery. The Great
Charter contained a few moderate provisions for checking the
abuses of purveyance as an instrument of local administration.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>The provisioning of castles.</i> Commanders of fortresses
were left perfectly free by Magna Carta to help
themselves to such corn and other supplies as they deemed
necessary for their garrisons. Immediate payment, however,
must be made in current coin (not in exchequer tallies) for
everything they requisitioned, unless the owner, on whom a
compulsory sale was forced, consented to postpone the date
of payment. The Charter of 1216 made a slight modification
in favour of castellans. Payment for goods taken from
inhabitants of the town where the castle was situated might
be legally delayed for three weeks, a term extended in 1217
to forty days. Such relaxation was perhaps necessary to
meet the case of a warden with an empty purse called on to
provide against an unexpected siege or other emergency;
but the peaceful townsmen, over whose dwellings the dark
walls of a feudal stronghold loomed, would not prove
creditors who pressed unduly for payment. Under Henry’s
Charters, as under that of John, immediate payment had to
be tendered to owners of goods who lived elsewhere than in
this neighbouring town.<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c017'><sup>[685]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>The requisitioning of horses and carts.</i> The provisions
of chapter 30, modified in subsequent re-issues,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>sought to prohibit sheriffs from exacting compulsory cartage
from the property of freemen.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <i>The appropriation of timber.</i> The succeeding chapter
confined the king and his officers to the use of such wood
as they could obtain from the royal demesnes.<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c017'><sup>[686]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>Branches of Purveyance not mentioned in Magna
Carta.</i> A wide field was left alike for the use and the
abuse of this prerogative, after due effect had been given to
these moderate provisions. In addition to the constant
friction kept up through many centuries by its employment
as a means of supplying the wants of the king’s household,
two minor aspects of purveyance came into special prominence
in later history.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>The requisition of forced labour.</i> Hallam points out
that the king’s rights of pre-emption over such goods as he
required were extended, by analogy, to his subjects’ labour.
"Thus Edward III. announces to all sheriffs that William
of Walsingham had a commission to collect as many
painters as might suffice for ‘our works in St. Stephen’s
chapel, Westminster, to be at our wages as long as shall be
necessary’; and to arrest and keep in prison all who should
refuse or be refractory; and enjoins them to lend their
assistance. Windsor Castle owes its massive magnificence
to labourers impressed from every part of the kingdom.
There is even a commission from Edward IV. to take as
many workmen in gold as were wanted, and employ them at
the king’s cost upon the trappings of himself and his household."<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c017'><sup>[687]</sup></a>
Perhaps, however, such demands did not form a
branch of purveyance at all, but were merely instances of
illegal royal encroachments.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>Billeting of soldiers in private houses.</i> This practice,
which may be considered a branch of purveyance, has
always been peculiarly abhorrent to public opinion in
England. It is as old as the reign of John; for when that
king visited York in 1201 he complained bitterly that the
citizens neither came out to meet him nor provided for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>wants of his crossbow-men. His threats and demands for
hostages were with difficulty turned aside by a money payment
of £100.<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c017'><sup>[688]</sup></a> Charles I. made an oppressive use of this
branch of what seems to have been once a perfectly legal
prerogative, punishing householders who opposed his unpopular
measures by quartering his dissolute soldiery upon
them, a practice branded as illegal by the Petition of Right
in 1628.<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c017'><sup>[689]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Castle-guard, or the liability to serve in the garrison of a
royal fortress, formed part of the feudal obligations of the
owners of certain freehold estates. This service was sometimes
due in lieu of attendance in the army; more usually the
tenant who owed garrison duty owed knight’s service as well.<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c017'><sup>[690]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>It was probably this duplication of duties that prevented
castle-guard from hardening into a separate tenure.<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c017'><sup>[691]</sup></a>
The right to enforce these obligations was naturally
entrusted to the constables of the various castles whose
duty it was to keep their garrisons at their full strength.
John, however, preferred to commute personal service of
castle-guard for money payments (analogous to the scutage
paid in lieu of knight’s service), and to man his feudal
towers with soldiers of fortune rather than with rebellious
Englishmen. Castellans were, therefore, in the habit of
demanding money even from those who offered personal
service. What was worse, when the freeholder had followed
John on distant service, he was mulcted in a money
payment because he had not stayed at home to perform
garrison duty during the same period. Both forms of
this abuse were absolutely forbidden in 1215. In certain
circumstances, however, this prohibition would have deprived
the king of what was equitably due to him. Suppose
he had granted two fiefs to the same tenant—one by simple
knight’s service, the other by castle-ward. A double holding
implied double service; the tenant could not in fairness
plead that the service of one knight rendered abroad
operated as the full discharge of the services of two knights
due from his two separate fiefs. Castle-guard must in
such a case be performed by an efficient deputy, or else the
usual compensation be paid. The reissue of 1217 amended
John’s Charter to this effect. Service with the army abroad
operated as a discharge of castle-guard at home, but not
where the tenant owed two services for two distinct fiefs.<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c017'><sup>[692]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The Charter here returned to the subject of purveyance,
one branch of which it practically abolished, except as
affecting villeins. No carts or horses belonging to a freeman
were to be requisitioned by any sheriff or bailiff for the
use of the Crown without the owner’s consent; that is to
say, they could not be requisitioned at all. The clause,
however, was carefully limited to freemen; the inference is
plain, that the horses and implements of villeins were left at
the disposal of the Crown without leave asked or price paid
for their use. The relative chapter of the reissue of 1216
practically restored this branch of purveyance; consent of
the owner, even when a freeman, need not be obtained,
provided hire was paid at the rates sanctioned by ancient
custom. Those rates, however, were definitely stated,
namely, 10d. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per diem</i></span> for a cart with two horses, and 1s. 2d.
for one with three.<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c017'><sup>[693]</sup></a> Thus the prerogative, though restored,
was not to be abused.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1217 it was again slightly restricted in favour of the
upper classes. No demesne cart of any “parson” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ecclesiastica
persona</i></span>), or knight, or lady, could be requisitioned by
the bailiffs. The “demesne” carts were, of course, those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>that belonged to the owner of the manor as opposed to the
carts of the villeins. Here again we have evidence of care
to make it clear, if not that villeins were to have no part or
parcel in the benefits of the great Charter, at least that their
rights, if they had any, could not stand against the more
important rights of the Crown. Yeomen and small freeholders
were also left exposed to this annoying form of
interference. Abuses continued. Purveyors would occasionally
lay hands on all available horses and carts in the
countryside—far more than they required—choosing perhaps
the season of harvest or some equally busy time. The
owners, who urgently required them for their own purposes,
would pay ransom money to regain possession. Edward I.
enacted that perpetrators of such deeds should be “grievously
punished by the marshals,” if they were members of his
household, and therefore amenable to the summary jurisdiction
of his domestic tribunal, or, if not members, then they
should pay treble damages and suffer imprisonment for
forty days.<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c017'><sup>[694]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>The Crown’s Claim to the Property of Felons.</i> The
Crown had gradually established certain rights, not too
clearly defined, in the property of all criminals formally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>indicted and sentenced for felony. John, here as elsewhere,
took full advantage of the vagueness of the law
to stretch prerogative to its utmost limit. Magna Carta,
therefore, attempted to define the exact boundaries of his
rights. The old customary law seems invariably to have
given the chattels of a condemned man to the owner of the
court which tried him, and the desire for such perquisites
must have created an unfortunate bias against the accused.
It was not possible, however, to adopt so simple a rule
with regard to the real estate of felons, for this was
claimed as escheat by the feudal lord from whom the
lands were held. Custom gave the land of a felon to
his feudal lord, and his chattels to the lord who tried
him. The Crown gradually encroached on the rights of
both, claiming the real estate of felons, as against mesne
lords, and their personal estate, as against the lords who
had jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>The felon’s lands.</i> No difficulty arose when Crown
tenants were convicted, since there the king was lord of
the fief as well as lord paramount, and claimed the whole
lands as escheat. When the condemned man was the
tenant of a mesne lord, however, a conflict of interests
occurred, and here a distinction, which gradually became
hard and fast, was drawn between treason and felony.<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c017'><sup>[697]</sup></a>
Treason was an offence against the person of the sovereign,
and it was probably on this ground that the king made
good his claim to seize as forfeit the entire estate, real
and personal, of every one condemned to a traitor’s death.
With regard to ordinary felons, what looks like a compromise
was arrived at. The king secured the right to
lay waste the lands in question and to appropriate everything
he could find there during the space of a year and
a day; after which period he was bound to hand over
the freehold thus devastated to the lord who claimed the
escheat. Such was the custom during the reign of Henry
II. as described by Glanvill, who makes it perfectly clear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>that before the lands were given up at the expiration of
the year, the houses were thrown down and the trees rooted
up, thus purging away the taint of crime and enriching
the exchequer with the price of the timber and building
materials.<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c017'><sup>[698]</sup></a> The exercise of this right of waste inflicted
upon the lord of the escheat an amount of damage out
of all proportion to the benefit it brought to the king.
The lord, when at last he entered into possession of the
escheated lands, found a desert, not a prosperous manor.<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c017'><sup>[699]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Coke has attempted to give a more restricted explanation
of the Crown’s rights in this respect, maintaining that the
“year and day” was not an addition to, but a substitute
for, the earlier right of “waste,” that the king renounced his
barbarous claims in return for the undisputed enjoyment of
the ordinary produce for one year only, and agreed, in
return for this, to hand over the land with all buildings and
appurtenances intact.<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c017'><sup>[700]</sup></a> The authorities he cites, however,
are inconclusive, and the weight of evidence on the other
side leaves little room for doubt. Not only does the
phrase “year day <em>and</em> waste” commonly used, create a
strong presumption; but Glanvill’s words in speaking of
the earlier practice are quite free from ambiguity,
while the document known as the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Praerogativa Regis</cite></span> is
equally explicit for a period long after Magna Carta.<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c017'><sup>[701]</sup></a>
Waste, indeed, was a question of degree, and the Crown was
not likely to be scrupulous in regard to felons’ lands, when
it allowed wanton destruction even of Crown fiefs held in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>honourable wardship.<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c017'><sup>[702]</sup></a> A year was by no means too long
for a thorough exercise of the right of waste.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wide as were the legal rights of the Crown, John
extended them illegally. When his officers had once
obtained a footing in the felon’s land, they refused to
surrender it to the rightful lord after the year and day had
expired. In 1205, Thomas de Aula paid 40 marks and a
palfrey to get what he ought to have had for nothing,
namely the lands escheated to him through his tenant’s
felony.<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c017'><sup>[703]</sup></a> Magna Carta prohibited such abuses for the
future; prompt evacuation must henceforth take place
when the year was over; and this settled the law for
centuries.<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c017'><sup>[704]</sup></a> The Crown long exercised its rights, thus
limited, and Henry III. sometimes sold his “year day and
waste,” for considerable sums. Thus, in 1229 Geoffrey of
Pomeroy was debited with 20 marks for the Crown’s rights
in the lands of William de Streete and for his corn and
chattels. This sum was afterwards discharged, however, on
the ground that the king, induced to change his mind,
doubtless by a higher bid, had bestowed these rights on
another.<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c017'><sup>[705]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>The felon’s chattels.</i> From an early date the king
enjoyed, like other owners of courts, the right to the
goods of the offenders he condemned. When Henry II.
reorganized the entire system of criminal justice, and formulated,
in the Assizes of Clarendon and Northampton, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>scheme whereby all grave offenders should be formally
indicted, and thereafter reserved for the coming of his own
justices, he established what was practically a royal monopoly
of jurisdiction over felons; and this logically implied a
monopoly over their chattels as well—an inference confirmed
by the express terms of article five of the earlier
Assize. As the list of “pleas of the Crown,” which is in
this connection identical with the list of “felonies,” grew
longer, so this branch of royal revenue increased proportionately
at the expense of the private owners of “courts
leet.” Even in the ten years between the criminal codes
of 1166 and 1176, two new offences were added to the
list, forgery and arson. The goods of all outlaws and fugitives
from justice likewise fell to the exchequer—the sheriff
who seized them being responsible for their appraised value.<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c017'><sup>[706]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The magnates in 1215 made no attempt to interfere
with this branch of administration, tacitly acquiescing in
Henry II.’s encroachments on their ancestors’ criminal
jurisdictions and perquisites. Under Henry III. and
Edward I. the forfeited goods of felons continued to form
a valuable source of revenue. In 1290 the widow of a
man who had committed suicide, and therefore incurred
forfeit as a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>felo de se</i></span>, bought in his goods and chattels for
£300, a high price, in addition to which the Crown
specially reserved its “year day and waste.”<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c017'><sup>[707]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Indictment, Conviction, and Attainder.</i> The Crown
could not appropriate the property of men merely suspected
of crime, however strong might be the presumption of guilt.
Mere accusation was not enough; a formal judgment was
required. The Charter refers to the lands of a “convicted”
offender, and conviction must be distinguished from indictment
on the one hand, and from attainder on the other;
since these formed three stages in the procedure for
determining guilt.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>Indictment.</i> It has already been shown<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c017'><sup>[708]</sup></a> how Henry
of Anjou tried to substitute, wherever possible, indictment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>by a jury for private appeal in criminal suits. The
Assize of Clarendon authorized such indictments to be
taken before sheriffs, and we learn from Bracton that
immediately the formal accusation had been made the
sheriff became responsible for the safety of the accused
man’s property, both real and personal. With the help
of the coroners and of lawful men of the neighbourhood
he must have the chattels appraised and inventoried, and
hold them in suspense until the “trial,” providing therefrom
in the interval “estovers,” that is, sufficient sustenance
for the accused and his family.<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c017'><sup>[709]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If the prisoner was acquitted or died before conviction,
then the lands and chattels were restored to him or to
his relatives, the Crown taking nothing. Reginald of
Cornhill, sheriff of Kent, was discharged in 1201 from
liability for the appraised value of the goods of a man
who, after indictment for the burning of a house, had
died in gaol <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>non convictus</i></span>. As the <cite>Pipe Roll</cite> clearly
states, his chattels did not pertain to the king.<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c017'><sup>[710]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>Conviction.</i> If the sheriff presided over all preliminary
procedure connected with indictment, only the
justices could “try” the plea, that is, give sentence according
to success or failure in the test appointed for the
accused man to perform.<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c017'><sup>[711]</sup></a> Prior to 1215 the usual test,
in accordance with the Assize of Clarendon, was the ordeal
of water in the ordinary case, or of the red-hot iron in
the case of men of high rank, or of women. If the suspected
man failed, sentence was a mere formality; he had
“convicted” himself of the felony. As a consequence of
the condemnation of ordeal by the Lateran Council of
1215, the verdict of guilty pronounced by what was virtually
a petty jury, became the normal “test” which
branded an offender as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>convictus</i></span>. This was long looked
on as an innovation, and accordingly the law refused
to compel the accused, against his will, to trust his fate
to this new form of trial. He might refuse to “put himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>upon his country,” and by thus “standing mute,” as
the phrase was, make his own “conviction” impossible,
saving himself from punishment and depriving the king
of his chattels and “year and day.” For centuries those
responsible shrank from the obvious course of treating
silence as equivalent to a plea of guilty; but while
liberty to refuse to submit to a jury’s verdict was theoretically
recognized, barbarous measures were in reality
adopted to compel consent. The Statute of Westminster
in 1275<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c017'><sup>[712]</sup></a> directed that all who refused should be imprisoned
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en le prison forte et dure</i></span>. The object seems to
have been to ensure that obstinate offenders should not
escape altogether unpunished, although they saved their
property by avoiding a technical conviction. This statutory
authority for strict confinement, however, was very
liberally interpreted by the agents of the Crown, who
treated it as a legal warrant for revolting cruelties, aimed
at compelling the stubborn to put themselves upon a
jury. Food and drink were virtually denied to them, a
little mouldy bread and a mouthful of impure water only
being allowed them upon alternate days; and at a later
date the prisoner was slowly crushed to death under great
weights “as heavy, yea heavier than he can bear.” Brave
men, guilty, or mayhap innocent, but suspicious of a corrupt
jury, preferred thus to die in torments, that they might save
to their wives and children the property which would upon
conviction have fallen to the Crown. The fiction was carefully
maintained that the victim of such barbarous treatment
was not subjected to “torture,” always illegal at common
law, but merely to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>peine forte et dure</i></span>, a perfectly legal
method of persuasion under the Statute of 1275. This
procedure was not abolished until 1772; then only was
an accused man for the first time deprived of his right
to "have his law"—his claim to ordeal as the old method
of proving his innocence. Until that date then, a jury’s
verdict was treated as though it were still a new-fangled
and unwarranted form of “test” usurping the place of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>the ordeal, although the latter had been virtually abolished
early in the thirteenth century.<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c017'><sup>[713]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <i>Attainder.</i> Coke in commenting on this passage
draws a further distinction between “conviction” which
resulted immediately either from a confession or from a
verdict of guilty, and “attainder” which required in
addition a formal sentence by the judge. In his age,
apparently, it was the sentence of attaint which implied
the forfeiture; looking as usual at Magna Carta through
seventeenth-century glasses, he seems surprised to find
“convicted” used where he would have written “attainted.”
Yet this distinction, if recognized at all in 1215, must
have been quite immaterial then. It was under the Tudor
sovereigns that the doctrine of the penal effects of attainder
was fully elaborated. When sentence was passed on a
felon, a blight as it were fell immediately upon him: his
blood was henceforth in the eye of the law impure, and
his kindred could inherit nothing that was his or that
came through him. No one could be treated as a blood
relation of one whose entire blood was tainted; and the
Crown naturally reaped the profit.<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c017'><sup>[714]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A series of statutes of the nineteenth century modified
the harshness with which this rule bore on the felon’s
innocent relations;<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c017'><sup>[715]</sup></a> and finally the Forfeiture Act of 1870<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c017'><sup>[716]</sup></a>
abolished “corruption of blood” and deprived the Crown
completely of all interest in the estates of felons, alike
in escheats and in chattels. Thus the word “attainted”
has become practically obsolete, and the distinction insisted
on by Coke has ceased to have any importance in modern
law. A criminal who is fulfilling the term of his sentence

<div class='translate'>

<p class='c001'>All kydells for the future shall be removed altogether
from Thames and Medway, and throughout all England,
except upon the sea coast.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The object of this provision is open to no reasonable
grounds of doubt; it was intended to remove from rivers
all obstacles likely to interfere with navigation. The full
importance of such a measure can only be understood when
the deplorable condition of the few roads which existed in
the Middle Ages is kept in view. The water-ways were
the great avenues of commerce; when these were blocked,
the townsmen and traders suffered loss, while those who
depended on them for their necessaries, comforts, and
luxuries, shared in the general inconvenience. Magna Carta
intervened in the interests of all classes, and demanded the
immediate removal of obstructions which interrupted inland
traffic. Only one class of impediments indeed was mentioned,
“kydells” (or fish-weirs), not because of the purposes to
which these were put, but because they were the form of
obstruction which called for repressive measures at the
moment. This word, whatever narrower technical meaning
it may have borne in later days, seems to have been used
by the framers of Magna Carta in a wide general sense, as
applying to all fixed and bulky contrivances or “engines”
intended to catch fish, and likely to interfere with the free
passage of boats.<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c017'><sup>[717]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>It has been gratuitously assumed that the motive for
prohibiting these “kydells” must have been of a similar
kind to the motive for constructing them; and that therefore
the object of the present chapter was to prevent the
Crown or others from acquiring a monopoly of rights of
fishing to the exclusion of the public. Law courts and
writers on jurisprudence for many centuries uniformly endorsed
this mistaken view, and treated Magna Carta as an
absolute prohibition of the creation of “several” (or exclusive)
fisheries in tidal waters.<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c017'><sup>[718]</sup></a> Although this legal doctrine has
been frequently and authoritatively enunciated, it rests undoubtedly
on a historical misconception. The Great Charter
sought to protect freedom of navigation, not freedom of fishing;
and this is obvious from the last words of the chapter:
kydells are to be removed from Thames and Medway and
throughout all England “<em>except upon the sea-coast</em>.” It
would have been a manifest absurdity to allow the creation
of monopolies of taking fish in the open seas, while insisting
on perfect freedom of fishing in rivers, the banks of which
were private property. The sense is quite clear: no objection
was taken to “kydells,” whatever they might be, so
long as they did not interfere with navigation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The erroneous view, however, had much to excuse it, and
acquired plausibility from the circumstance that the destruction
of obstacles to the free passage of boats incidentally
secured also free passage for salmon and other migratory
fish; and that <em>later</em> statutes, when legislative motives had
become more complicated, were sometimes passed with both
of these objects in view. The change is well illustrated by
a comparison of the words of two statutes of 1350 and of
1472 respectively. The first of these repeats the substance
of this chapter of Magna Carta, and thus explains its
object:—“Whereas the common passage of boats and ships
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>in the great rivers of England be oftentimes annoyed by the
inhancing of gorces, mills, weirs, stanks, stakes, and kydells.”<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c017'><sup>[719]</sup></a>
Here there is no allusion to fish or rights of fishing.
The later act, while confirming, under penalties, previous
statutes for the suppression of weirs, not only states its own
intention as twofold, namely, to protect navigation of rivers,
and “also in safeguard of all the fry of fish spawned within
the same,” but retrospectively and unwarrantably attributes
a like double motive to Magna Carta.<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c017'><sup>[720]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>So far as the Thames and Medway were concerned, this
provision contained nothing new. To the Londoners,
indeed, the keeping open of their river for trade was a
matter of vital importance. The right to destroy all <i>kydelli</i>
in the Thames and Medway had been purchased from
Richard I. for 1500 marks, and a further sum had been
paid to John to have this confirmed. The charter of
Richard I. is dated 14th July, 1197; and that of John, 17th
June, 1199. Each king declared, in words practically
identical, that Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury,
and others had pointed out “that great detriment and
discommodity hath grown to our said city of London, and
also to the said realm by occasion of the said kydells.”
Accordingly each charter declared that the king has
“granted and steadfastly commanded that all kydells that
are in the Thames be removed wheresoever they shall be
within the Thames; also we have quit-claimed all that
which the Warden of our Tower of London was wont yearly
to receive from the said kydells. Wherefore we will and
steadfastly command that no warden of the said Tower, at
any time hereafter, shall exact anything of any one, neither
molest nor burden nor make any demand of any person by
reason of the said kydells.” John’s charter of 1199 went
further than that of Richard, making it clear that the prohibition
referred to the Medway as well as to the Thames,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>and granting the right to inflict a penalty of £10 upon anyone
infringing its provisions.<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c017'><sup>[721]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Magna Carta merely confirmed, and extended to all rivers,
a prohibition already secured by the Londoners specially
for their own river. The provision was repeated in the
reissues of Henry III. The citizens, however, did not rest
content with a clause in a general enactment, but purchased
for 5000 marks three new charters exclusively in their own
favour. One of these, dealing with kydells in Thames and
Medway, was issued by Henry on 18th February, 1227, in
terms almost identical with those of Richard and John.<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c017'><sup>[722]</sup></a></p>

interests, but that wide rights of administration and jurisdiction over the
waters of the Thames were conferred on the city authorities (rights which
previous to 1197 had been exercised, it is assumed, by the Constable of the
Tower of London). See Noorthouck, <cite>New History of London</cite> (1773)
p. 36, and Luffman, <cite>Charters of London</cite> (1793) p. 13. The latter says of

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>In extorting from John a solemn promise to restrict the
use of the particular writ here referred to, the barons gained
something of infinitely greater value than a petty reform of
court procedure; they committed their enemy to a complete
reversal of a line of policy vigorously and consistently
pursued for at least half a century. The process by which
the jurisdiction of the king’s courts was steadily undermining
that of the feudal courts was now to be suddenly
arrested. Magna Carta by this apparently inoffensive
clause was grappling in reality with an urgent political
problem of the day, fraught with tremendous practical issues
alike for king and barons. This can only be understood
in connection with the technical details on which it hinges.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Royal Writs and the Feudal Jurisdictions.</i> The class
of writs, called from their initial word “Writs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe</i></span>,”
was a large one, and freely used by the Crown for
issuing peremptory orders of various kinds to its officers and
others. This provision of Magna Carta had special reference
to one type of these writs only, the so-called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe
quod reddat</i></span>.<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c017'><sup>[723]</sup></a> These were intended to inaugurate, before the
king’s justices, pleas for determining the ownership of property
either by battle or by grand assize—preferably the
latter. They were called “Writs of Right,” because they
treated of questions of title, not merely questions of possession.</p>

<p class='c001'>The form of a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe quod reddat</i></span>, as actually issued
from the Chancery of Henry II. (who invented it), is given
by Glanvill, and its terms illustrate the insidious methods
by which the Crown encroached on feudal jurisdictions.<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c017'><sup>[724]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>The writ was directed to the sheriff, and began bluntly:—“Command”
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe</i></span>) A. “to give back” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quod reddat</i></span>) to
B. a piece of ground there specified, or alternatively, “to explain
why he had not done so” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ostensurus quare non fecerit</i></span>).
The real object does not, however, appear upon the surface.
It was by no means intended that the man to whom the
command was issued, should abandon his claim without discussion.
He would naturally take the alternative allowed
him, namely, appear before the king’s justices and there
“show cause” why he had not obeyed the order, by proving
(if he could) a better title to the property in dispute than
that alleged by the rival claimant. The writ, which on the
surface reads merely as a summary and final command
to hand over the estate to another, is really an “original
writ” commencing a litigation in the king’s court. One
important effect of its issue was that all proceedings
instituted in inferior tribunals must immediately stop.</p>

<p class='c001'>The feudal lord, in whose court baron the plea would
naturally have been decided, was thus robbed by the king
of his jurisdiction. With it, he lost also authority over
his tenants, and numerous fees and perquisites. The
writ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe</i></span> was thus mainly an ingenious device for
“evoking” a particular cause from the manorial court
to the king’s court.<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c017'><sup>[725]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Henry II., in inventing or systematizing the legal procedure
known as “the writ process,” because its leading
feature was that it forbade any action to be begun without
a royal writ, had two objects in view. While
reforming by its instrumentality the entire administration
of justice in England, the king hoped by the same
means, to destroy gradually the feudal privileges of his
magnates. He intended, step by step, to draw into his
own courts all pleas relating to land. Questions of property
were to be tried before his justices, by combat or,
at the defendant’s option, by the grand assize; questions
of possession (without any option) by the appropriate
petty assize. The barons showed no desire to dispute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>the Crown’s assumption of a monopoly over the petty
assizes; indeed they cordially acquiesced in this by the
terms of chapter 18 of the Charter. The grand assize
was another matter; they refused to be robbed of their
right to determine, in their own courts baron, proprietary
actions between their own tenants. Indeed, for such
wholesale extension of the king’s jurisdiction over pleas
of land, Henry II. had absolutely no precedent. He
had made the Crown strong and then used its power for
his own aggrandizement. The king’s courts had increased
their authority, as a distinguished American historian
has expressed it, “by direct usurpation, in derogation of
the rights of the popular courts and manorial franchises,
upon the sole authority of the king.”<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c017'><sup>[726]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Now, the chief instrument devised by Henry for effecting
such usurpations was precisely this particular form
of the writ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe</i></span> (or Writ of Right).<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c017'><sup>[727]</sup></a> Tenants whose
titles were challenged gladly purchased such writs, as
the only way to escape trial by combat; and John frequently
issued them to the prejudice of feudal lords,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>whose jurisdiction was thus curtailed. The barons in
1215 considered this a grievance; and Magna Carta in
demanding its redress deliberately attempted to arrest
the process of royal usurpation. The tide must be turned
back; the system of feudal justice, now fast becoming
obsolete, must in its entirety be revived. Each freeman
or baron must be left without competition as the sole
source of justice to his own tenants in all pleas of
land, unmolested by these new-fangled writs of right.
It was not intended, of course, to abolish completely
the extensive and useful class of writs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe</i></span>; but
merely to prevent the Crown using them as an engine
of encroachment upon manorial jurisdictions.<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c017'><sup>[728]</sup></a> The king
might keep his own court and issue writs to his own
tenants; but let him respect the courts of others. For
the future, such writs must not be issued “concerning
any tenement whereby a freeman may lose his court.”
Writs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe</i></span> might be freely used for any other purpose,
but not for this. This one purpose, however, was
exactly what had specially recommended it to the great
king who had invented it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The present chapter must, therefore, be regarded as
containing one of the most reactionary provisions of
the entire Charter. The barons had, at last, succeeded
in compelling John to promise a complete reversal of a
central part of the deliberate policy of his father.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, then, under the guise of a small change in legal
procedure, was concealed a notable triumph of feudalism
over the centralizing policy of the monarchy—a backward
step, which, if given full effect to, might have ushered in a
second era of feudal turbulence such as had disgraced the
reign of Stephen. We are told on high authority that
John’s acknowledgment of "the claims of the feudal lord
to hold a court which shall enjoy an exclusive competence
in proprietary actions"—was one which “Henry II. would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>hardly have been forced into.”<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c017'><sup>[729]</sup></a> That may well be; but
John had already more than once rejected this proposal
with violence. In 1215, he could no longer strive against
the inevitable, and agreed under compulsion to provisions
which he had no intention to keep. The concession,
although insincere, was nevertheless an important one.
The substance of chapter 34 was repeated with some
trivial verbal alterations in all future issues of Magna
Carta.<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c017'><sup>[730]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Influence of this Provision on later Legal Development.</i>
One important question still remains: Was this provision
observed in practice? The answer is partly Yes, but
chiefly No. Its letter was stringently enforced; but its
spirit was evaded. (1) The Chancery, in obedience to
Magna Carta, ceased to issue this particular form of writ
in such a manner as to cause a freeman “to lose his court.”
It was still issued to Crown tenants; but strictly denied
to all under-tenants, who were thus left to find redress at
the feudal court of the magnate from whom they held their
land.<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c017'><sup>[731]</sup></a> The measure thus forced on the Crown in the selfish
interests of the baronage inflicted hardship on tenants of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>mesne lords, in whose faces the doors of the king’s tribunals,
opened to them by Henry II., were once more
closed in all pleas touching their freeholds. In such cases
the court baron of their lord was now their only source
of justice, and in that court they could not get the benefit
of the improved methods of royal procedure. In particular,
the grand assize was a royal monopoly. The magnates,
indeed, desired to adopt it, but this was rendered
difficult by an obstacle which the Crown made the most
of.<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c017'><sup>[732]</sup></a> They had difficulty in getting together twelve knights
willing to act as jurors; and they could not force them to
give a sworn verdict against their will. The king might
compel; but a mesne lord could only persuade. Men of
the required status objected to the waste of time, and
dreaded the danger of being punished for false verdicts,
inseparable from the duty of serving on a grand assize.
Whatever hopes the barons may have entertained of
overcoming such difficulties were disappointed. In 1259
the Provisions of Westminster declared that freeholders
should not be compelled to swear against their will "since
no one can make them do this without the King’s warrant."<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c017'><sup>[733]</sup></a>
It was the deliberate policy of Edward I. to exaggerate
all such difficulties, putting every obstacle in the way of
private courts, until he reduced their jurisdictions to
sinecures.<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c017'><sup>[734]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>(2) While the letter of Magna Carta was strictly kept,
its spirit was evaded. It was impossible to give loyal
effect to an enactment which went directly counter to
the whole stream of progress. Manorial justice was falling
fast into disrepute and abeyance, while royal justice was
becoming more efficient and more popular, and was soon
to rid itself of all competitors and obtain a monopoly.
Under-tenants, deprived of access to the king’s court by
the direct road of the writ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe</i></span>, sought other and more
tortuous modes of entrance. Legal fictions were devised.
The great problem was how to evade Magna Carta without
openly infringing it. The king’s justices and would-be
litigants in the king’s courts formed a tacit alliance for
this end, but had to proceed by slow and wary steps, in
the teeth of bitter opposition from the powerful owners
of seignorial courts. The process adopted consisted of a
series of formal changes in the technical procedure of the
king’s courts. Its key lies in the ingenious original (or
originating) writs invented by Crown lawyers, which really
effected one thing while professing to effect something
quite different. These new writs were known as writs
of entry and came half-way between writs of right (or
writs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe</i></span>) and the petty assizes; half-way between
writs commencing actions dealing with title (and therefore
attacked by chapter 34 of Magna Carta) and writs dealing
with possession (and therefore welcomed by chapter 18).
Writs of entry were thus, from the point of view of the
magnate with his private court, wolves in sheep’s clothing.
They professed to determine a question of <em>possession</em>, but
really decided a question of <em>ownership</em>. At first the pleas
to which they could be applied were few and special.
Steadily new forms of action were devised to cover almost
every conceivable case. The process of evolution was a
long one, commencing soon after 1215, and virtually concluding
with chapter 29 of the Statute of Marlborough,
or rather with the liberal construction which Crown lawyers
placed upon that statute in the following reign.</p>

<p class='c001'>Edward I., at the height of his power, and eager to set his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>house in order, shrank from an open breach of the Great
Charter, gladly adopting subtle expedients to cheat mesne
lords out of the rights secured to them by the present
chapter. In Edward’s reign, then, the legal machinery
invented for this purpose was brought to perfection, so
that thereafter no action relating to freehold was ever
again tried in the courts baron of the magnates. All such
pleas were, in direct violation of the spirit of Magna Carta,
decided in the courts of the king.<a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c017'><sup>[735]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The claimant, then, had no need to infringe the prohibition
against the writ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe</i></span> when he could obtain another
writ, equally effective, under a different name. A writ of
entry was, indeed, to a peaceable plaintiff, infinitely preferable
to a writ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe</i></span>, which could only be issued to
one prepared to <em>offer</em> battle, the option of accepting lying
with his adversary. Crown tenants, even, who could
obtain the writ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe</i></span>, came to prefer the more modern
substitute; and clause 34 of Magna Carta was thereafter
virtually obsolete.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the indirect effects of the clause was of a most
unfortunate nature. The necessity it created for effecting
reforms by a tortuous path did great and lasting harm
to the form of English law. Legal fictions have indeed
their uses, by evading technical rules of law in the interests
of substantial justice. The price paid for this relief, however,
is usually a heavy one. Complicated procedures and
underhand expedients have to be invented, and these lead
in turn to new legal technicalities of a more irrational
nature than the old ones. It would have been better in
the interests of scientific jurisprudence if so desirable a
result could have been effected in a more straightforward
manner. The authors of Magna Carta must bear the blame.<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c017'><sup>[736]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f726'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r726'>726</a>. See Bigelow, <cite>Hist. of Procedure</cite>, 78. Glanvill, read between the
lines, contains admissions which support this view. Friend of prerogative
as he was, he shows consciousness of a distinction between the
proper and improper use of the royal jurisdiction. Thus in I. c. 3, he
speaks of the king’s courts as normally dealing with “pleas of baronies”
(<i>i.e.</i> litigations concerning Crown fiefs); in I. c. 5, he speaks of what
he evidently considers an abnormal expansion of this jurisdiction to
any plea anent a free tenement or fief, if the Crown so desired,—that
is, the Crown claimed an option, in circumstances admitted to be abnormal,
of deciding pleas as to fiefs held under mesne lords. This distinction
is identical with that on which the present chapter of Magna Carta
is based.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f727'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r727'>727</a>. The normal procedure seems to have included the following steps:
(<i>a</i>) a claimant in the court of the lord of the fief offers to prove by
battle a better title than the tenant in possession; (<i>b</i>) the tenant applies
to the king to have the issue decided by grand assize; (<i>c</i>) a writ
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe quod reddat</i></span> is then issued in the form given by Glanvill, I.
c. 6, (already cited) virtually forbidding the claimant to proceed elsewhere
than before the king; (<i>d</i>) a second writ follows in the form
given by Glanvill, II. c. 8, forbidding the lord “to hold in his court
the plea between the litigants M. and R. because M. the tenant has
put himself upon my assize.” Cf. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>supra</i></span>, c. 18.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r730'>730</a>. The version of 1216 speaks of a “free tenement,” where that of 1215
spoke merely of a “tenement.” The addition makes no change, since in
no case could the king’s courts try pleas affecting the villeins of mesne
lords. Perhaps the object of the addition is to make it clear that there
was no interference with the king’s rights over the holdings of his own
villeins on royal demesne.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f731'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r731'>731</a>. The writs, thus restricted so that only tenants <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in capite</i></span> could obtain
them, were thereafter known as writs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praecipe in capite</i></span>. Under that
name the writ appears in Coke’s version of the charter of Henry III.
(<cite>Second Institute</cite>, p. 38), and in the translation given in the <cite>Statutes at
Large</cite> of the reissue of 1225. There is no authority in any text of Magna
Carta for the addition of the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in capite</i></span>, and the explanation of their
presence in these versions must be sought in the tendency of lawyers in an
age long subsequent to 1215 to re-edit Magna Carta in the technical
language of their own day. Coke emphasised the restriction of this remedy
to Crown tenants. “No man ought to have this writ out of the Chancery
upon a suggestion, but oath must be made, before the granting thereof,
that the land is holden of the king <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in capite</i></span>,” (p. 38), and he illustrates
what he says by reference to two cases drawn from the reign of Edward I.</p>

against which John protested. See <cite>Rot. Pat.</cite>, I. 72, for writ dated 23rd
May, 1207. In one case at least, exceptional it is true, John acquiesced in
grand assizes being held in feudal courts. On 4th May, 1201, he granted
licence to Hubert Walter (and his successors) to hold them for his tenants
in gavelkind, a tenure peculiar to Kent. See <cite>New Rymer</cite>, I. 83.</p>

Barons (<cite>Select Charters</cite>, 386), and the comment of Pollock and Maitland, I.
182: “The voice of the nation, or what made itself heard as such, no

to wit, “the London quarter”; and one width of cloth
(whether dyed, or russet, or halberget), to wit, two ells
within the selvedges; of weights also let it be as of measures.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This chapter re-enacted an important ordinance of Richard
I., usually known as the Assize of Measures, but sometimes
as the Assize of Cloth. That ordinance, the exact date of
which is 20th November, 1197, was, according to modern
conceptions of the proper sphere of government, partly
commendable and partly ill-advised. It showed, on the
one hand, a praiseworthy desire to set up definite standards
of weights and measures, uniform throughout all parts of
England. It strove thus to overcome the serious inconvenience
experienced by traders, who met with varying
standards as they moved with their wares from place to
place. What was of more importance, the assize sought
to obviate also the frauds frequently perpetrated upon
buyers by unscrupulous merchants under the shelter of
ambiguous weights and measures. The London quarter
must, therefore be used everywhere for corn; and one
measure for wine or beer. So far good. On the other
hand, the ordinance of Richard went much further than
modern ideas of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>laissez faire</i></span> would tolerate. In particular,
legitimate freedom of trade was interfered with by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>cloth regulations reported by Roger of Hoveden.<a id='r737' /><a href='#f737' class='c017'><sup>[737]</sup></a> No
cloth, he tells us, was to be woven except of a uniform
width, namely, “two ells within the lists.”<a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c017'><sup>[738]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Dyed cloths, it was provided, should be of equal quality
through and through, as well in the middle as at the
outside. Merchants were prohibited from darkening their
windows by hanging up, to quote the quaint language of
the ordinance, “cloth whether red or black, or shields
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>scuta</i></span>) so as to deceive the sight of buyers seeking to
choose good cloth.” Coloured cloth was only to be sold in
cities or important boroughs. Here we have, apparently,
a sumptuary law meant to ensure that the lower classes
went in modest grey attire. Six lawful men were to be
assigned to keep the Assize in each county and each
important borough. These custodians of measures must
see that no goods were bought or sold except according
to the standards; imprison those found guilty of using
other measures, whether by their own admission or by
failure in the ordeal (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>confessus vel convictus</i></span>); and seize the
chattels of defaulters for the king’s behoof. If the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>custodes</i></span>
performed their duties negligently they were to suffer
amercement of their chattels.<a id='r739' /><a href='#f739' class='c017'><sup>[739]</sup></a> Richard’s Assize of Measures
was supplemented in 1199 by John’s Assize of Wine, which
tried to regulate the price of wines of various qualities,<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c017'><sup>[740]</sup></a> an
attempt not repeated in Magna Carta.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same author who gives us the text of the ordinance
of 1197 tells us also that its terms were found to be too
stringent, and had to be frequently relaxed in practice.<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c017'><sup>[741]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>This was done in 1201. The king’s justices, we are told,
wished to seize the cloth of certain merchants on the
ground that it was less than the legal width. They compromised,
however, by accepting a great sum of money
“to the use of the king and to the damage of many.”
Thus Hoveden denounces what he regards as an unlawful
bargain between the justices and the traders for injuring
buyers by evading the strict letter of the ordinance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many examples of evasion may be found in the <cite>Pipe
Rolls</cite> both before and after Magna Carta. The justices,
indeed, were usually more bent on collecting fines for its
breach than on enforcing the Assize. In 1203 two merchants
of Worksop were amerced each in half a mark for selling
wine contrary to the Assize, while the custodians of measures
of the borough were also mulcted in one mark for performing
their duty negligently—an exact illustration of the
words of the ordinance.<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c017'><sup>[742]</sup></a> In the same year a fine of one
mark was imposed on certain merchants “for stretching
cloth,” in order, presumably, to bring it to the legal width.<a id='r743' /><a href='#f743' class='c017'><sup>[743]</sup></a>
Merchants frequently paid heavy fines to escape the
ordinance altogether.<a id='r744' /><a href='#f744' class='c017'><sup>[744]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When the barons in 1215 insisted upon John enforcing
his brother’s ordinance in all its rigour, they took a step
in their own interests as buyers, and against the interests of
the trade guilds as sellers. Although this provision was
repeated in all subsequent charters, it seems never to have
produced much effect. The difficulty of enforcing such
provisions in their strictness was great, and evasion continued.
One example may suffice. In the second year of
Henry III.<a id='r745' /><a href='#f745' class='c017'><sup>[745]</sup></a> the citizens of London paid 40 marks that they
might not be questioned for selling cloth less than two
yards in width. Here is an illustration of the practice of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>the judges to which Hoveden had objected, and which Magna
Carta had apparently failed to put down. Sometimes, however,
the provisions of Richard’s Assize of Measures and
of John’s Assize of Wine were still enforced. In 1219 a
Lincolnshire parson, with a liberal conception of the scope
of his parochial duties, had to pay 40s. for wine sold <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>extra
Assisam</i></span>.<a id='r746' /><a href='#f746' class='c017'><sup>[746]</sup></a> Parsons, apparently, might engage in trade, but
only if they conformed to the usual regulations.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r738'>738</a>. At a later date cloth of an alternative standard width was also
legalized, viz., of one yard between the “lists.” Hence arose the distinction
between “broadcloth” (that is, cloth of two yards) and “streits”
(that is, narrow cloth of one yard). (See Statute I Richard III. c. 8.)

often supposed to be closely related. The particular writ
upon which such emphasis is here laid had been invented by
Henry II. to obviate the judicial duel in certain cases, by
allowing the accused man virtually to refer the question of
his guilt or innocence to the sworn verdict of his neighbours.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Trial by Combat prior to the Reign of John.</i> The
crucial moment in judicial proceedings during the Middle
Ages arrived, as has already been explained,<a id='r747' /><a href='#f747' class='c017'><sup>[747]</sup></a> when the
“test” or “trial” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex</i></span>) appointed by the court was
attempted by one or both of the litigants. The particular
form of proof to which the warlike Norman barons were
attached was the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span>, and it was only natural that such
of the old Anglo-Saxon aristocracy as associated with them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>on terms of equality should adopt their prejudices. Hence
“combat” became the normal mode of deciding all serious
disputes among the upper classes. Even from the first,
however, it seems not to have been competent for property
of less than 10s. in value,<a id='r748' /><a href='#f748' class='c017'><sup>[748]</sup></a> and it soon came to be specially
reserved for two classes of disputes—civil pleas instituted by
writ of right, and criminal pleas following on “appeal.”
The present chapter is concerned with the latter only.</p>

<p class='c001'>An “appeal” in this connection was entirely different
from the modern appeal from a lower to a higher court. It
was a formal accusation of treason or felony made by a
private individual on his own initiative, and was usually
followed by judicial combat between the appellant and
appellee, each of whom fought in person. Such a right
was necessary in an age when the government had not
yet assumed a general responsibility for bringing ordinary
criminals to justice, or was at least so lax and spasmodic
in performing that function as to leave many wrongdoers
unpunished. Appeal followed by battle was probably
in its origin a form of legal procedure substituted
for the older blood-feud.<a id='r749' /><a href='#f749' class='c017'><sup>[749]</sup></a> Those who had suffered wrong
would be more readily dissuaded from their vendetta if they
were allowed instead the right of judicial duel under fair
conditions laid down by the court. The Norman trial by
combat was thus a survival from an earlier stage of society
when the wronged person, not the magistrate, had been the
avenger of crime; and this explains several peculiarities—why,
for example, when the accused had uttered “that
hateful word craven,”<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c017'><sup>[750]</sup></a> thus confessing himself vanquished
and deserving a perjurer’s fate, the victorious accuser was
entitled to his vengeance, even in the face of a royal pardon.
When Henry of Essex, constable and standard-bearer of
Henry II., accused by his enemy, Robert de Montfort,
in 1163, had been worsted in the combat, the royal
favour could not shield him, though apparently the king’s
connivance enabled him, by renouncing his possessions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>and becoming a monk, and therefore dead in law, to
escape actual death by hanging.<a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c017'><sup>[751]</sup></a> It would seem that at
an early date the whole procedure had resembled even more
closely a legalized private revenge, since the appellant who
had vanquished his foe was allowed personally to put him
to death. "The ancient usage was, so late as Henry IV.’s
time, that all the relations of the slain should drag the
appellee to the place of execution."<a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c017'><sup>[752]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The evils of trial by combat are obvious. From the first
it was dreaded and avoided by the traders of the boroughs,
who paid heavily for charters of exemption. Their aversion
spread to the higher classes, and was shared by Henry II.
To that great statesman, endowed with the ardent instincts
of a reformer, despising utterly all obsolete and irrational
modes of procedure, and quite devoid of reverence for tradition,
trial by combat was entirely abhorrent. He would
gladly have abolished it out and out if he had dared; but
he prudently followed the more subtle policy of slowly undermining
its vitality. For this purpose he used four expedients,
which are of great interest in respect that they throw
light on the process by which trial by jury superseded trial
by battle.<a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c017'><sup>[753]</sup></a> (1) Every facility was afforded the parties to a
civil suit who were willing to forego the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span> voluntarily.
Henry placed at their disposal, as a substitute, a procedure
which had by his ancestors been specially reserved for the
service of the Crown. Litigants might refer their rival
claims to the oath of a picked body of local neighbours:
the old recognitors thus developed into the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jurata</i></span>. This
course was possible, however, only where both parties consented,
and it had many features in common with a modern
arbitration. (2) In pleas relating to the title and possession
of land Henry went further, granting to the defendant the
option of a peaceful settlement even when the claimant preferred
battle. The men to whose oaths such cases were
referred were known as an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>assisa</i></span>, not a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jurata</i></span>, since both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>litigants had not consented. The three various groups of
assizes welcomed by the barons in chapter 18 have already
been discussed. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>assisa</i></span>, like the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jurata</i></span>, could be applied
only to civil pleas. (3) Attempts were made to discourage
trial by combat in criminal pleas also by discouraging the
exercise of the right of private “appeal,” its natural prelude.
The corporate voice of the accusing jury was made
as far as possible to supersede the individual complaint of
the injured party offering battle. Only the near blood relation,
or the liege lord, of a murdered man was allowed to
prove the offender’s guilt by combat; while a woman’s right
of appeal was kept within narrow limits.<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c017'><sup>[754]</sup></a> (4) A wide field
was still left for private appeal and battle; but Henry
endeavoured to narrow it by a subtle device. In appeals of
homicide, where the accusation was not made <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bona fide</i></span>, but
maliciously or without probable cause, the appellee was
afforded a means of escaping the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span>. He might
apply for the writ which forms the subject of this
chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>The Writ of Life and Limb.</i> The writ here referred
to, better known to medieval England as the writ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de odio
et atia</i></span>,<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c017'><sup>[755]</sup></a> was intended to protect from duel men unjustly
appealed of homicide. Rash or malicious accusations
might be raised by turbulent knights, who made fighting
their pastime, in order to gratify a grudge against traders or
other men of peace, and many an appealed man was glad to
purchase from the king permission to escape by assuming
the habit and tonsure of a monk;<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c017'><sup>[756]</sup></a> but Henry desired to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>save innocent men from the risk of failure in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span>
without this subterfuge. If the accused asserted that his
appellant acted “out of spite and hate” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de odio et atia</i></span>), he
might purchase from the royal chancery a writ known by
that name, which referred the preliminary plea thus raised
to the verdict of a sworn body of twelve recognitors drawn
from his own locality. If his neighbours upheld the plea
all further proceedings on the appeal were quashed: the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span> was avoided.<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c017'><sup>[757]</sup></a> A similar privilege was afterwards
extended to all those guilty of homicide in self-defence, or of
homicide by misadventure, not of deliberate murder.<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c017'><sup>[758]</sup></a> Soon
every man appealed of murder, whether guilty or not, alleged
as a matter of course that he had been accused groundlessly
and maliciously, mere “words of common form.” This expansion
of the writ’s sphere of usefulness was accompanied
by another change. The main issue of guilt or innocence,
not merely the preliminary pleas, came to be determined by
the neighbours’ verdict,<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c017'><sup>[759]</sup></a> which, whether for or against the
accused, was treated as final. No further proceedings were
necessary: none were allowed. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span> had at last
been successfully elbowed aside, although it was not abolished
until 1819.<a id='r760' /><a href='#f760' class='c017'><sup>[760]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>Subsidiary Uses of the Writ.</i> This inquest of life and
limb, devised as a means of substituting a sworn verdict for
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span> in cases of homicide, has often been claimed as
the direct antecedent of, if not as identical with, the procedure
which in the seventeenth century became so valuable
a bulwark of the subject’s liberty, under the name of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>habeas
corpus</i></span>. This is a mistake; the modern writ of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>habeas corpus</i></span>
was developed out of an entirely different writ, which had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>for its original object the safe-keeping of the prisoner’s body
in gaol, not his liberation from unjust confinement.<a id='r761' /><a href='#f761' class='c017'><sup>[761]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The opinion generally though erroneously held, is not without
excuse; for the writ mentioned by Magna Carta, besides
effecting its main purpose, was put to another and subsidiary
use, which bears a superficial resemblance to that served by
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>habeas corpus</i></span> of later centuries. Considerable delay
might occur between the appellee’s petition for the writ
of inquisition and the verdict upon it. In the interval, the
man accused of murder had, in the normal case, no right
to be released on bail, a privilege allowed to those suspected
of less grave crimes. This was hard in cases where the
accused was the victim of malice, or guilty only of justifiable
homicide. Prisoners, placed in such a plight, might purchase
from the Crown, always ready to accept fees in a
worthy cause, royal writs which would save them from
languishing for months or years in gaol. The writ best
suited for this purpose was that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de odio et atia</i></span>, since it was
already applicable to presumably innocent appellees for
another purpose.<a id='r762' /><a href='#f762' class='c017'><sup>[762]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As trial by combat became rapidly obsolete, the original
purpose of the writ was forgotten, and its once subsidiary
object became more prominent. Before Bracton’s day
(possibly even before the date of Magna Carta) this change
had taken place: the writ had come to be viewed primarily
as an expedient for releasing upon bail homicides <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per
infortunium</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>se defendendo</i></span>. Bracton, in giving the form
of the writ,<a id='r763' /><a href='#f763' class='c017'><sup>[763]</sup></a> declares it to be iniquitous that innocent men
accused of homicide should be long detained in prison;
therefore, he tells us, an inquisition is wont to be made at
the request of sorrowful friends—whether the accusation is
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bona fide</i></span> or has been brought <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de odio et atia</i></span>. This pleasing
picture of a king moved to pity by the tearful friends of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>accused men scarcely applies to John, who listened only
to suitors with long purses which they were ready to empty
into his exchequer. The writs which liberated homicides
had become a valuable source of revenue. Sheriffs were
frequently reprimanded for releasing prisoners on bail without
the king’s warrant, but, in spite of heavy amercements,
they continued their irregularities, either through favour
to individuals or in return for bribes. Thus, in 1207,
Peter of Scudimore paid to the exchequer a fine of 10
marks for setting homicides free upon pledges, without
warrant from the king or his justices.<a id='r764' /><a href='#f764' class='c017'><sup>[764]</sup></a> In that year, John
repeated his orders, strictly forbidding manslayers to be set
free upon bail, unless by royal command, until they had
received judgment in presence of the king’s justices.<a id='r765' /><a href='#f765' class='c017'><sup>[765]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To John, then, the excessive and arbitrary fees to be
received for this writ, constituted its greatest merit;
whereas the barons claimed, as mere matter of justice,
that it should be issued free of charge to all who needed
it. John’s acceptance of their demands, contained in the
present chapter, was repeated in all reissues, and apparently
observed in practice. The procedure during the reign of
Henry III. is described by Bracton in a passage already
cited. After the writ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de odio</i></span> had been received, an inquest,
he tells us, must be held speedily, and if the jury decided
that the accusation had been made maliciously, or that
the slaying had been committed in self-defence or by
accident, the Crown was to be informed of this. Thereafter,
from the chancery would be issued a second writ, the
form of which is also given by Bracton (known in later
days as the writ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tradias in ballium</i></span>) directing the sheriff,
on the accused finding twelve good sureties of the county,
to “deliver him in bail to those twelve” till the arrival of
the justices. Such writs, however, if in one sense “freely”
issued, had always to be paid for. A certain Reginald, son
of Adam, when accused in 1222, offered one mark to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>king for a verdict of the three neighbouring counties (it was
a Lincolnshire plea), as to whether the accusation was made
because of “the ill-will and hate” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per odium et atiam</i></span>)
which William de Ros, appellant’s lord, bore to Reginald’s
father “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vel per verum appellum</i></span>.”<a id='r766' /><a href='#f766' class='c017'><sup>[766]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A long series of later statutes enforced or modified this
procedure. These have been interpreted to imply frequent
changes of policy, sometimes abolishing and sometimes reintroducing
the writ and the procedure which followed it.<a id='r767' /><a href='#f767' class='c017'><sup>[767]</sup></a>
This is a mistake; the various statutes wrought no radical
change, but merely modified points of detail; sometimes
seeking to prevent the release of the guilty on bail, and
sometimes removing difficulties from the path of the innocent.
The Statute of Westminster, I., for example, after a
preamble which animadverted on the manner in which
sheriffs impannelled juries favourable to the accused, provided
that inquests “shall be taken by lawful men chosen
out by oath (of whom two at the least shall be knights)
which by no affinity with the prisoners nor otherwise are
to be suspected.”<a id='r768' /><a href='#f768' class='c017'><sup>[768]</sup></a> The Statute of Gloucester, on the
other hand, ordered the strict confinement, pending trial,
of offenders whose guilt was apparent.<a id='r769' /><a href='#f769' class='c017'><sup>[769]</sup></a> The Statute of
Westminster, II. once more favoured prisoners, providing
by chapter 12 for the punishment of false appellants or
accusers, and by chapter 29 that “lest the parties appealed
or indicted be kept long in prison, they shall have a
writ of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>odio et atia</i></span>, like as it is declared in Magna Carta
and other Statutes.”<a id='r770' /><a href='#f770' class='c017'><sup>[770]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The writ in question was in use in the year 1314,<a id='r771' /><a href='#f771' class='c017'><sup>[771]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>and seems never to have been expressly abolished, but to
have sunk gradually into neglect, as appeals became obsolete
and commissions of gaol delivery were more frequently
held.</p>

<p class='c001'>IV. <i>Later History of Appeal and Battle.</i> The right of
private accusation was restricted only, not abolished, by
Henry II. and his successors. It could not be denied to
any injured man, who was not suspected of abusing his
right. Prosecutions in the king’s name by way of indictment
and jury trial supplemented, without superseding,
private prosecutions by way of appeal and battle. The
danger of a second prosecution might hang over the head of
an accused man after he had “stood his trial” and been
honourably acquitted. <a id='corr425.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='In'>It</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_425.14'><ins class='correction' title='In'>It</ins></a></span> was unfair that he should be
kept in such suspense for ever; and, accordingly, the
Statute of Gloucester provided that the right of appeal
should lapse unless exercised within year and day of the
commission of the offence.<a id='r772' /><a href='#f772' class='c017'><sup>[772]</sup></a> To ensure that the accused
should escape all risk of a double prosecution for the same
crime, it was necessary that the Crown should supplement
the provisions of this act by delaying to prosecute until the
year and day had expired. This rule was followed in 1482.
Such immunity from arraignment at the king’s suit for the
space of twelve months (combined with the provisions of
the Statute of Gloucester) would undoubtedly have obviated
the possibility of two trials for one offence; but it produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>a worse evil of a different kind, by facilitating the escape
of criminals from justice. After experience of its pernicious
effects, this rule was condemned by the act of parliament
which instituted the Star Chamber.<a id='r773' /><a href='#f773' class='c017'><sup>[773]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This remedied the more recent evil, but revived the old
injustice; the same statute enacted that acquittal should
not bar the right of appeal of the wife or nearest heir of
a murdered man. Thus, once again, a man declared innocent
by a jury might find himself still exposed to a second
prosecution. This unjust anomaly remained without formal
redress until the nineteenth century; and in 1817 the
British public was startled to find that a long-forgotten
legal procedure of the dark ages still formed part of the
law of England. The body of a Warwickshire girl, Mary
Ashford, was discovered in a pit of water under circumstances
which suggested foul play. Suspicion fell on
Abraham Thornton, who had been in her company on
the night when she disappeared. After indictment and
trial at Warwick Assizes on a charge of rape and murder,
he was acquitted. The girl’s eldest brother, William Ashford,
was not satisfied by what was apparently a perfectly
honest verdict. He tried to secure a second trial, and with
this object claimed the ancient right of appeal of felony,
which the judges did not see their way to refuse. Ashford’s
attempt to revive this obsolete procedure was met by
Thornton’s revival of its equally obsolete counterpart.
Summoned before the judges of King’s Bench, he offered
to defend himself by combat, throwing down as “wager
of battle” a glove of approved antique pattern. The judges
had to admit his legal right to defend himself against the
appeal “by his body,” and Thornton thus successfully
foiled the attempt to force him to a second trial, as the
court never contemplated the possibility of a medieval
judicial combat being actually fought in the nineteenth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>century. The appeal was withdrawn and the proceedings
terminated.<a id='r774' /><a href='#f774' class='c017'><sup>[774]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The unexpected revival of these legal curiosities of an
earlier age led to their final suppression. In 1819 a
Statute was passed abolishing proof by battle alike in
criminal and in civil pleas; and the right of appeal fell
with it.<a id='r775' /><a href='#f775' class='c017'><sup>[775]</sup></a></p>

The proceedings which followed on appeal sometimes took place before the

In neither case were they popular. One of the charges brought against
Richard II. by the Parliament which deposed him, was that “in violation
of Magna Carta” (that is, probably, of chapter 39) persons maliciously
accused of treasonable words were tried before the constable and marshal,

to fight against appellants “young, strong, and hearty.” See <cite>Rot.

</div>

<p class='c001'>By these provisions the Charter reverts once more to the
subject of wardship, laying down three rules which will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>better understood when their sequence is somewhat altered,
the second being taken first.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>Ordinary wardship.</i> The reason for claiming wardship
from lands held in chivalry, namely, that a boy tenant
could not perform military service, did not apply to fee-farm,
to socage, or to burgage. There was much looseness
of usage, however; and of this John took full advantage.
The Charter stated the law explicitly; wardship was not
due from any such holdings, except in the somewhat anomalous
cases where lands in fee-farm expressly owed military
service.<a id='r776' /><a href='#f776' class='c017'><sup>[776]</sup></a> As petty serjeanties (although mentioned in the
present chapter in a different connection) are not expressly
said to share this exemption, it may be inferred that the
barons admitted John’s wardship over them, just as in
the case of great serjeanties. In Littleton’s time, the
law had been changed. Petty serjeanties were then
exempt.<a id='r777' /><a href='#f777' class='c017'><sup>[777]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>Prerogative wardship.</i> When a tenant-in-chivalry died
leaving two separate military fiefs held of different mesne lords,
each of these lords enjoyed, during the minority, wardship over
his own fief. This was perfectly fair to all parties; but
if the ward held one estate of the Crown, and another of a
mesne lord, the king claimed wardship over both; and
that, too, even when the Crown fief was of small value.<a id='r778' /><a href='#f778' class='c017'><sup>[778]</sup></a>
Such rights were known as “prerogative wardship,” and
thus limited, were in 1215 perfectly legal, however inequitable
they may now seem.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>a</i>) <i>Fee-farm, socage, and burgage.</i> John, however,
pushed this right further, and exercised prerogative wardship
over fiefs of mesne lords, not merely by occasion of
Crown fiefs held in chivalry, but also by occasion of Crown
fiefs held by any other free tenure. It was outrageous
thus to claim prerogative wardship in respect of fee-farm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>socage, or burgage lands, which were themselves exempt
from ordinary wardship. John accordingly was made to
promise amendment.<a id='r779' /><a href='#f779' class='c017'><sup>[779]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) <i>Petty Serjeanties</i><a id='r780' /><a href='#f780' class='c017'><sup>[780]</sup></a> were in a slightly different
position. Although Magna Carta did not abolish the
Crown’s rights of ordinary wardship over these, it forbade
that that should form an occasion of prerogative wardship.
The king might enjoy the custody of his own fief if he
pleased, but not of the wider fiefs of others on that
pretext.<a id='r781' /><a href='#f781' class='c017'><sup>[781]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Prerogative wardship (even in the limited form admitted
by Magna Carta) might involve a double hardship on the
mesne lord deprived by it of the custody of his fief.
Suppose that the common tenant held lands from a mesne
lord on condition of, say, five knights’ service, in addition to
his Crown fief. The king seized both fiefs on his death,
nominally as a compensation for the loss of military service,
which the minor heir could not render. Yet when a
scutage ran the king demanded from the mesne lord payments
in proportion to his full <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quota</i></span> without allowing
for the fees of five knights taken from him by prerogative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>wardship. This is no imaginary case. The barons in
1258 complained of the practice and demanded redress.<a id='r782' /><a href='#f782' class='c017'><sup>[782]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r781'>781</a>. See Bracton, <i>folio</i> 87 b. The <cite>Note Book</cite>, case 743, contains a good
illustration. The motive for these restrictions was clearly to prevent injustice
to mesne lords. It was probably, however, an indirect consequence
of Magna Carta that a similar rule came to be applied where no mesne lord
was injuriously affected. In 1231 a certain Ralf of Bradeley died who had
held two separate freeholds of the Crown, (i) a small fee by petty serjeanty
for which he rendered twenty arrows a year, and (ii) land of considerable
value held in socage. The Crown took possession of both estates, on the
assumption that the admitted right of wardship over the petty serjeanty
brought with it a right of wardship over the socage lands also (although
these would have been exempt if they had stood alone). The king sold his
rights for 300 marks. Ralf’s widow claimed the wardship of the socage lands,
on the ground that these were of much greater value than those held by
serjeanty. Her argument was upheld, and the 300 marks were refunded
by the exchequer to the disappointed purchaser. See <cite>Pipe Roll</cite>, 5 Henry

<p class='c001'>The evident intention of this provision was to prevent
irregularities at the critical stage of a trial, when the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex</i></span>
appointed by the court was attempted. This word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex</i></span>, in
its technical sense, may be correctly applied to any form of
judicial test, such as compurgation, ordeal, or combat, the
precise meaning required in each particular case being
determined by the context.<a id='r783' /><a href='#f783' class='c017'><sup>[783]</sup></a> In this passage of Magna
Carta, it may be used in its widest connotation, but reasons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>will be immediately adduced for the belief that <em>ordeal</em> was
specially present to the minds of those who framed it.
Bailiffs, (the word is a wide one, including certainly
the sheriffs and their underlings, and possibly also the
stewards who presided in manorial courts)<a id='r784' /><a href='#f784' class='c017'><sup>[784]</sup></a> had evidently
been guilty of irregularities which public opinion of the
day condemned. So much is clear: but authorities differ
widely as to the exact nature of the abuse which is here
prohibited.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Probable Object of the Chapter.</i> The key is supplied
by the words of article 4 of the Assize of Clarendon, the
provisions of which still regulated the Crown’s practice in
criminal cases in the reign of John. That ordinance explains
the procedure to be followed when robbers, murderers,
or thieves, apprehended by the sheriffs upon indictment,
were brought before the justices for trial: “and the sheriffs
shall bring them before the justices; and with them they
shall bring two lawful men of the hundred and of the
village where they were apprehended, to bear the record of
the county and of the hundred, as to why they had been
apprehended; and, there, before the justices they shall make
their law.” This “law” is elsewhere in the ordinance clearly
identified with ordeal;<a id='r785' /><a href='#f785' class='c017'><sup>[785]</sup></a> and the purport of the whole was
that accused men could not be put to ordeal except in
presence of two lawful men who had been present at the
indictment and had come before the justices specially to
bear witness thereof. In other words, the sheriff’s verbal
report of the indictment “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sine testibus fidelibus ad hoc
inductis</i></span>” was not sufficient. The “county” and the
“hundred” which had accused the prisoner must send
representatives to bear record of the facts.<a id='r786' /><a href='#f786' class='c017'><sup>[786]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>The ordeal indeed was a solemn affair for which careful
rules had been laid down. Every precaution was taken
against the sheriff abusing his authority. His account of
the indictment was checked by the presence of subordinate
officials as well as of these members of the accusing jury.
Moreover, lords of feudal courts, claiming this franchise,
could only exercise it under royal warrant. Henry, the
inventor of the system, sternly repressed all irregularities
whether those of his own bailiffs or of the stewards of
private lords.<a id='r787' /><a href='#f787' class='c017'><sup>[787]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The same rules of procedure prevailed under John, who
was less careful, however, than his father had been, to
suppress irregularities. In Magna Carta he promised
amendment. The presence of witnesses required by the
Assize of Clarendon was once more insisted on as a check
upon the capricious or unfair use of the ordeal. The
Charter of 1216 repeated this provision without alteration.
In 1217, however, a change occurred, which was undoubtedly
a consequence of the virtual abolition of the
ordeal by the Lateran Council in 1215. The framers of
Henry’s second reissue, no longer so engrossed in pressing
matters of state as they had been in the previous year,
found leisure to adjust points of administrative detail.
The simple reference to ordeal was inappropriate now
that new forms of trial were taking its place. The
justices, indeed, scarcely knew what test they should
appoint, when ordeal had been forbidden. They seem
sometimes to have resorted to compurgation and sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>to battle; but the sworn verdict of neighbours was fast
occupying the ground left vacant. The new Charter then
made it clear that the provisions applied in 1215 to ordeal
were to be extended to the other tests which were now
being substituted for it. The “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad legem</i></span>” of John’s Charter
became in the new version “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad legem manifestam nec ad
juramentum</i></span>,” which might very well include battle and the
decisions of jurors, as well as ordeal.<a id='r788' /><a href='#f788' class='c017'><sup>[788]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Medieval Interpretations of the Passage.</i> Ignorance of
the exact nature of the abuse prohibited may well be
excused at the present day, since it had become obscure
within a century of the granting of the Charter. Some
legal notes of the early fourteenth century, containing three
alternative suggestions, have come down to us.<a id='r789' /><a href='#f789' class='c017'><sup>[789]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(1) The first interpretation discussed, and apparently
dismissed, in these notes, was that Magna Carta by this
prohibition wished to ensure that no one should serve on a
jury (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in juratam</i></span>) unless he had been warned by a timely
summons. This far-fetched suggestion is clearly erroneous.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) The next hypothesis raised is that the clause prevented
the defendant on a writ of debt (or any similar writ)
from winning his case by his unsupported oath, where
compurgators ought to have sworn along with him.
Exception was, in this view, taken to the bailiff treating
favoured <em>defendants</em> in civil pleas with unfair leniency.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) A third opinion is stated and eulogized as a better one,
namely that the Charter prohibited bailiffs from showing undue
favour to <em>plaintiffs</em> in civil pleas. The defendant on a writ
of debt (or the like) should not, in this interpretation of
Magna Carta, be compelled to go to proof at all (that is, to
make his “law”) unless the plaintiff had brought “suit”
against him (that is, had raised a presumption that the claim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>was good, by production of preliminary witnesses or by
some recognized equivalent).<a id='r790' /><a href='#f790' class='c017'><sup>[790]</sup></a> This last of the three interpretations
thus suggested in the reign of Edward II. has its
modern adherents, as will immediately be shown; but the
discussion inaugurated in Plantagenet days has not yet
received an authoritative settlement. It was discussed in
the Court of Common Pleas so recently as 1700,<a id='r791' /><a href='#f791' class='c017'><sup>[791]</sup></a> and
historians at the present day differ as widely as do the
lawyers.</p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>Modern Interpretations of the Passage.</i> No two
of the recent authorities hold precisely similar opinions.
Four views, at least, may be distinguished. (1)
The provision is sometimes regarded as an attempt
to prevent plaintiffs in civil suits from being treated
with undue favour to the prejudice of defendants. A
“suit” of witnesses (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sectatores</i></span>) had to be produced in
court by the plaintiff before any “trial” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex</i></span>) could
take place at all. Bailiffs were forbidden to allow, through
slackness, favour, or bribery, this rule to be relaxed. This
interpretation, which was adopted by the author of the
<cite>Mirror of Justices</cite>, and by the writer of the notes appended
to the Year Book already cited, found favour
with Chief Justice Holt in 1700.<a id='r792' /><a href='#f792' class='c017'><sup>[792]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) A second theory treats the clause as forbidding
bailiffs (whether royal officers or manorial stewards) to use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>their authority to forward suits to which they happened
to be parties. In certain circumstances, it would seem,
the steward who presided as his master’s representative
over the manorial court claimed the right to put a
defendant to his proof, without first producing “suit”
or its equivalent, a privilege, however, which he could
exercise only once in every year. Royal bailiffs claimed
this privilege, and that without any similar restrictions.
One object of Magna Carta, in this view, was to
reduce bailiffs to an equality with other litigants. No
longer should their bare assertion enable them to dispense
with the formalities which the court required
from ordinary plaintiffs before putting their adversaries
to the risk of “a law” or proof.<a id='r793' /><a href='#f793' class='c017'><sup>[793]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(3) In marked contrast to these two theories, which
read Magna Carta as preventing undue favour to plaintiffs,
comes a third which regards it as forbidding undue
favour to defendants. The Crown, it is pointed out,
favoured Jews against Christians with whom they went
to law. The Hebrew defendant in a civil suit “might
purge himself by his bare oath on the Pentateuch,
whereas in a similar case a Christian, as the law then
stood, might be required to wage his law twelve-handed—<i>i.e.</i>
with eleven compurgators.”<a id='r794' /><a href='#f794' class='c017'><sup>[794]</sup></a> Magna Carta, it has
been suggested, struck at this preferential treatment of
Jewish litigants, trebly hated as aliens, capitalists, and
rejectors of Christ. If so, the attempt failed; for in
1275 a certain Hebrew, named Abraham, was allowed
“to make his law single-handed on his Book of the
Jewish Law” in face of the plaintiff’s protest that this
was contrary to the custom of the realm.<a id='r795' /><a href='#f795' class='c017'><sup>[795]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(4) A fourth theory reads the chapter as a prohibition
of undue severity in criminal prosecutions. A formal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>indictment by the accusing jury must always precede
the “trial.” No bailiff ought to put anyone to the water
or the red-hot iron upon suspicion, or private information.<a id='r796' /><a href='#f796' class='c017'><sup>[796]</sup></a>
Much may be said for this interpretation so far as it
goes; but the Assize of Clarendon and Magna Carta
agree in demanding something more. It was not enough
that indictment should precede ordeal; they required
that some members of the presenting jury who had
made the accusation at the first diet should accompany
the sheriff before the justices at the final diet, there to
bear testimony both as to the nature of the crime and as
to the fact of the indictment. Before anyone could be put
“to his law,” the sheriff’s verbal report must be corroborated
by the testimony of representative jurors.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f783'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r783'>783</a>. Dr. Stubbs (<cite>Const. Hist.</cite>, I. 576) translates “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex</i></span>” in this passage by
“compurgation or ordeal.” Pollock and Maitland (II. 604, n.) explain
that the word “does not necessarily point to unilateral ordeal; it may
well stand for trial by battle.” Thayer (<cite>Evidence</cite>, 199–200) extends it even
further, so as to embrace judicially appointed tests of every kind—battle,
ordeal of fire or water, simple oath, oath with compurgators,
charter, transaction witnesses, or sworn verdict. Bigelow (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Placita
Anglo-Normannica</cite></span>, 44) cites from Domesday Book cases where litigants
offered proof <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>omni lege</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>omnibus legibus</i></span>, that is, in any way the court
decided. Sometimes <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex</i></span> had a more restricted meaning; in the Customs
of Newcastle-on-Tyne <cite>(Select Charters</cite>, 112) it seems to mean compurgation
as opposed to combat.</p>

authority of the <cite>Mirror of Justices</cite>, extends it to all king’s justices and
ministers. The unqualified “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ballivus</i></span>” of this passage should, perhaps, be

year a certain Roger owed half a mark for being present at an ordeal “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sine

put a man “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>injuste ad aquam</i></span>” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ibid.</i></span>). Apparently the bailiffs were sometimes

<p class='c001'><a href='#r792'>792</a>. See City of London <i>v.</i> Wood (12 Modern Reports, 669). Holt held
the clause of Magna Carta to mean that the plaintiff, unless he had
his witnesses, could not put a defendant to his oath. Pollock and Maitland,
II. 604, seem to concur, to the extent at least of counting this
as one of the abuses condemned by c. 38: “The rule which required a
suit of witnesses had been regarded as a valuable rule; in 1215 the
barons demanded that no exception to it should be allowed in favour
of royal officers.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>This chapter occupies a prominent place in law-books,
and is of considerable importance, although there are
reasons for holding that its value has been grossly exaggerated.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Its Main Object.</i> It has been usual to read it as
containing a guarantee of trial by jury to all Englishmen;
as absolutely prohibiting arbitrary commitment; and as
undertaking solemnly to dispense to all and sundry an
equal justice, full, free, and speedy.<a id='r798' /><a href='#f798' class='c017'><sup>[798]</sup></a> The traditional interpretation
has thus made it, in the widest terms, a promise
of law and liberty, and good government to every one.<a id='r799' /><a href='#f799' class='c017'><sup>[799]</sup></a>
A careful analysis of the words of the clause, read in
connection with its historical genesis, suggests the need
for modifications of this view. It was in accord with the
practical genius of this great document that it should
direct its energies, not to the enunciation of vague platitudes
and well-sounding generalities, but to the reform of
a specific and clearly defined group of abuses. Its main
object was to prohibit John from resorting to what is
sometimes whimsically known in Scotland as “Jeddart
justice.”<a id='r800' /><a href='#f800' class='c017'><sup>[800]</sup></a> It forbade him for the future to place execution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>before judgment. Three aspects of this prohibition may be
emphasized.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>Judgment must precede execution.</i> In some isolated
cases, happily not numerous, John proceeded, or threatened
to proceed, by force of arms against recalcitrants as though
assured of their guilt, without waiting for legal procedure.<a id='r801' /><a href='#f801' class='c017'><sup>[801]</sup></a>
Complaint was made of arrests and imprisonments
suffered “without judgment” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>absque judicio</i></span>); and these
are the very words used in the "unknown charter"—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Concedit
Rex Johannes quod non capiet homines absque judicio</cite></span>.”<a id='r802' /><a href='#f802' class='c017'><sup>[802]</sup></a>
Both the Articles of the Barons and Magna Carta expand
this phrase. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Absque judicio becomes nisi per legale
judicium parium suorum vel per legem terre</i></span>, thus guarding,
not merely against the more obvious evil—execution without
judgment—but also against John’s subtler device for
attacking his enemies by a travesty of judicial process.
The Charter asks not only for a “judgment,” but for a
“judgment of peers” and “according to the law of the
land.” Two species of irregularities were condemned by
these words; and these will be explained in the two
following subsections.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Per judicium parium</i></span>: every judgment must be
delivered by the accused man’s “equals.” The need for
“a judgment of peers” was recognized at an early date
in England.<a id='r803' /><a href='#f803' class='c017'><sup>[803]</sup></a> It was not originally a class privilege of
the aristocracy, but a right shared by all grades of freeholders;
whatever their rank they could not be tried by
their inferiors.<a id='r804' /><a href='#f804' class='c017'><sup>[804]</sup></a> In this respect English custom did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>differ from the procedure prescribed by feudal usage on
the Continent of Europe.<a id='r805' /><a href='#f805' class='c017'><sup>[805]</sup></a> Two applications of this general
principle had, however, special interest for the framers of
Magna Carta: the “peers” of a Crown tenant were his
fellow Crown tenants, who would normally deliver judgment
in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia Regis</i></span>; while the “peers” of the tenant
of a mesne lord were the other freeholding tenants
assembled in the Court Baron of the manor. In either
case judgments were given <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per pares curiae</i></span>, who decided
what “test” should be appointed, who thereafter
sat as umpires while their accused “peer” carried this
through to success or failure, and who finally pronounced
a sentence in accordance with the result. Crown tenants
and under-tenants alike complained that they were deprived
by John of the only safeguard they could trust, the
judgment of a full court of Englishmen of their own rank,
who presumably, therefore, had no undue bias towards
conviction. John, not here an innovator, but merely resorting
wholesale to practices used sparingly and with
prudence in earlier reigns, had set these rights openly at
defiance. His political and personal enemies were frequently
exiled, or deprived of their estates, by the judgment
of a tribunal composed entirely of Crown nominees ready
to give any sentence which John might dictate. Magna
Carta promised a return to the recognized ancient practice.
No freeman should henceforth suffer in person or in property
as the result of a judgment by the professional judges
forming the bench of Common Pleas, or the other bench
known as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>coram rege</i></span>. This was to abolish not merely
the abuses of John, but the system of Henry II., which
he abused.</p>

<p class='c001'>The varied meanings conveyed by the word “peers” to a
medieval mind, together with the nature of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium parium</i></span>,
may be further illustrated by the special rules applicable to
four exceptional classes of individuals:—(<i>a</i>) all Jews of
England and Normandy enjoyed under John’s charter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>10th April, 1201, the right to have complaints against them
judged by men of their own race. For them a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium
parium</i></span> was a judgment of Jews.<a id='r806' /><a href='#f806' class='c017'><sup>[806]</sup></a> (<i>b</i>) A foreign merchant, by
later statutes, obtained the right to a special form of
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium parium</i></span>—to a jury of the “half tongue” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de
medietate linguae</i></span>), composed partly of aliens of his own
country.<a id='r807' /><a href='#f807' class='c017'><sup>[807]</sup></a> (<i>c</i>) The peers of a Welshman seem, in some
disputes with the Crown, to have been men drawn from the
marches, and therefore unlikely to side entirely either
with the English or with the Welsh point of view. Such
at least is the most plausible interpretation of the phrase
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in marchia per judicium parium suorum</i></span>,” occurring in
later chapters of Magna Carta, and granting to the Welsh
redress of wrongful disseisins.<a id='r808' /><a href='#f808' class='c017'><sup>[808]</sup></a> (<i>d</i>) A Lord Marcher occupied
a peculiar position, enjoying rights denied to barons
whose estates lay in more settled parts of England. In 1281
the Earl of Gloucester, accused by Edward I. of a breach of
allegiance, claimed to be judged, not by the whole body of
Crown tenants, but by such as were, like himself, lords
marchers.<a id='r809' /><a href='#f809' class='c017'><sup>[809]</sup></a> These illustrations show that a “trial by peers”
had a wider and less stereotyped meaning in the Middle
Ages than it has at the present day.<a id='r810' /><a href='#f810' class='c017'><sup>[810]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Per legem terrae.</i></span> No freeman could be punished
except in accordance with the law of England. These often-quoted
words were used in Magna Carta with special though
not perhaps exclusive reference to the narrow technical
meaning of “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex</i></span>” which was so prominent in 1215 and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>which has been already explained.<a id='r811' /><a href='#f811' class='c017'><sup>[811]</sup></a> The Great Charter
promised that no plea, civil or criminal, should henceforth
be decided against any freeman until he had failed in
the customary "proof"—whether battle, or ordeal, or
otherwise.<a id='r812' /><a href='#f812' class='c017'><sup>[812]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This older, more technical signification was gradually forgotten,
and “the law of the land” became the vague and
somewhat meaningless phrase of the popular speech of to-day.
It was only natural that this change of meaning
should be reflected in subsequent statutes reaffirming,
expanding, or explaining Magna Carta. An important
series of these, passed in the reigns of Edward III. and
Richard II., shows how the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per legem terrae</i></span> of 1215 was
read in the fourteenth century as equivalent to the wider
expression “by due process of law,” and how the Great
Charter was interpreted as prohibiting the trial of men
for their lives and limbs before the King’s Council on mere
informal and irresponsible suggestions, sometimes made
loosely or from malicious and interested motives.<a id='r813' /><a href='#f813' class='c017'><sup>[813]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>The Act of 1352, for example, after reciting the provision
of Magna Carta at present under discussion, insisted on
the necessity of “indictment or presentment of good and
lawful people of the same neighbourhood where such deeds
be done.” Coke,<a id='r814' /><a href='#f814' class='c017'><sup>[814]</sup></a> founding apparently on the terms of these
fourteenth-century statutes, makes “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per legem terrae</i></span>” of
the Charter equivalent to “by due process of law” and that
again to “by indictment or presentment of good and lawful
men,” thus finding the grand jury enshrined in
Magna Carta. The framers of the Petition of Right<a id='r815' /><a href='#f815' class='c017'><sup>[815]</sup></a> read
the same words as a prohibition, not only of imprisonment
“without any cause showed” but also of proceedings
under martial law, thus interpreting the aims of
King John’s opponents in the light of the misdeeds of King
Charles, and applying to the rude system established by
Henry of Anjou reforms more appropriate to the highly
developed administration of the Tudors.</p>

<p class='c001'>These glosses must be discarded; the words of John’s
Charter promised a threefold security to all the freemen of
England. Their persons and property were protected from
the king’s arbitrary will by the rule that execution should
be preceded by a judgment—by a judgment of peers—by a
judgment according to the appropriate time-honoured “test,”
battle, compurgation, or ordeal.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <i>The meaning of “vel.”</i> The peculiar use of the word
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vel</i></span>” introduced an unfortunate element of ambiguity. No
proceedings were to take place "without lawful judgment
of peers or by the law of the land"—“or” thus occurring
where “and” might naturally be expected. Authorities
on medieval Latin are agreed, however, that “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vel</i></span>” is sometimes
equivalent to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>et</i></span>.<a id='r816' /><a href='#f816' class='c017'><sup>[816]</sup></a> Comparison with the terms of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>chapter 52 and with those of the corresponding Article
of the Barons places the matter almost beyond doubt. The
25th of the Articles of the Barons had provided that all
men disseised by Henry or Richard should “have right
without delay by judgment of their peers in the king’s
court,” giving no hint of any possible alternative to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium
parium</i></span>. Chapter 52 of the Charter, in supplementing the
present chapter, describes the evils complained of in both
as acts of disseisin or outlawry by the king “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sine legale
judicio parium suorum</i></span>,” leaving no room for ambiguity.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>The Scope of the Protection afforded.</i> The object of
the barons was to protect themselves and their friends
against the king, not to set forth a scientific system of
jurisprudence: the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium parium</i></span> was interposed as a
barrier against prosecutions instituted by the king, not
against appeals of private individuals. Pleas following
upon accusations by the injured party were held in 1471
not to fall within the words of Magna Carta.<a id='r817' /><a href='#f817' class='c017'><sup>[817]</sup></a> This was a
serious limitation; but as against the Crown the scope of
the protection afforded by the Great Charter was very
wide indeed. Care was taken that the three-fold safeguard
should cover every form of abuse likely to be practised
by John.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Capiatur vel imprisonetur.</i></span> If these two words were
literally interpreted, and the provision they embody strictly
enforced, all orderly government would be at an end.
When a crime has been committed, the offender must be
arrested and provisionally detained, without waiting for
any judgment, whether of peers or otherwise. A man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>accused of crime may, indeed, justly demand three things:
a trial before condemnation, that the trial be not too long
delayed, and that under some circumstances he should be
meanwhile released on bail. Magna Carta goes further,
promising complete exemption from arrest until judgment
had been passed upon him. Here the barons extorted a
wider concession than could possibly be enforced. Their
excess of caution had led them to use a loose and
dangerously wide phrase, which ought not to be too
literally interpreted.<a id='r818' /><a href='#f818' class='c017'><sup>[818]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Aut disseisiatur.</i></span> Avarice was one of the most frequent
motives of John’s oppressions: the whole machinery
of justice was valued primarily as an engine for transferring
land and money to his treasury. Crown tenants frequently
found their estates appropriated by the Crown as escheats.
That this was one of their grievances to which the barons
attached supreme importance is shown in many ways: by
the care taken in the 25th of the Articles of the Barons
and in chapter 52 of the Charter to provide procedure
for restoring to their rightful owners estates of which they
had been improperly “disseised,”<a id='r819' /><a href='#f819' class='c017'><sup>[819]</sup></a> and by the terms of
certain writs issued by John after the treaty at Runnymede,
for example the letter of 19th June to his half-brother,
the Earl of Salisbury, explaining that peace had been made
on condition of the immediate restoration of all “lands,
castles, and franchises from which we have caused any one
to be disseised <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>injuste et sine judicio</i></span>.”<a id='r820' /><a href='#f820' class='c017'><sup>[820]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>Later versions of Magna Carta (beginning with that of
1217) are careful to define the objects to be protected
from disseisin: “free tenements, franchises, and free
customs.”<a id='r821' /><a href='#f821' class='c017'><sup>[821]</sup></a> (<i>a</i>) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Liberum tenementum.</i></span> “Free” tenements
were freeholds as opposed to the holdings of villeins.
None of their belongings thus protected were more highly
valued by the barons than their feudal strongholds.<a id='r822' /><a href='#f822' class='c017'><sup>[822]</sup></a>
Castles claimed by great lords as their own property are
mentioned in many writs of the period—for example, in
that to the Earl of Salisbury already cited—while chapter
52 of Magna Carta gives them a prominent place among
the “disseisins” to be restored. (<i>b</i>) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Libertates</i></span>” covered
feudal rights and incidents of too intangible nature to be
appropriately described as “holdings.” In a sense, all the
rights secured by Magna Carta were “liberties”; but the
word is probably used here as equivalent to “franchises,”
embracing feudal jurisdictions, immunities, and privileges
of various sorts, all treated by medieval law as falling
within the category of “property.” (<i>c</i>) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Consuetudines</i></span> had
two meanings, a broad general one and a narrower
financial one.<a id='r823' /><a href='#f823' class='c017'><sup>[823]</sup></a> As the Charter of 1217 uses a proprietary
pronoun (no freeman shall be disseised of <em>his</em> free customs),
it probably refers to such rights as those of levying tolls
and tallages. These vested interests were of the nature
of monopolies throughout the territory of the lord who
enjoyed them; and it follows that Coke, in treating this
passage as a text on which to preach the doctrine that
monopolies have always been illegal in England, aims
unusually wide of his mark. Commenting on the words
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de libertatibus</i></span>,” he declares that “generally all monopolies
are against this great charter, because they are against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>the liberty and freedom of the subject and against the
law of the land.”<a id='r824' /><a href='#f824' class='c017'><sup>[824]</sup></a> In this error he has been assiduously
followed.<a id='r825' /><a href='#f825' class='c017'><sup>[825]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Aut utlagetur, aut exuletur, aut aliquo modo destruatur.</i></span>
The practice of placing outside the protection of the law
such evildoers as could not be brought to justice had its
origin in those early days when the existing machinery of
law was inadequate to the work required of it. With the
progress of order and organization, the criminal’s chances
of evading justice became fewer; and the declaration of
outlawry, which could only be made in the county court,
tended to become a mere formality, preliminary to the
forfeiture of the outlaw’s lands and goods. The expedient
was one which recommended itself peculiarly to John’s
genius; it was his deliberate policy to terrify those with
whom he had quarrelled, until they fled the country;
then to summon them three times before the county
court to answer the charges against them, knowing well
that they dared not face his corrupt and servile officers;
and finally to have them formally outlawed and their
property seized. Such had been the fate suffered by
two of the baronial leaders, Robert Fitz Walter and
Eustace de Vesci, in the autumn of 1212.<a id='r826' /><a href='#f826' class='c017'><sup>[826]</sup></a> Outlawry
was not always, however, a mere formality in John’s
reign. The man who had been outlawed was outside the
pale of society; anyone might slay him at pleasure; in
the grim phrase of the day, he bore "a wolf’s head"
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>caput lupinum</i></span>), and might be hunted like a noxious
beast. A reward of two marks was offered for each outlaw’s
head brought to Westminster. This sum was paid
in 1196 for the head of William of Elleford.<a id='r827' /><a href='#f827' class='c017'><sup>[827]</sup></a> The word
“exiled” explains itself; and commentators have very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>properly noted the care taken to widen the scope of the
clause by the use of the words “or in any other way
molested.”<a id='r828' /><a href='#f828' class='c017'><sup>[828]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(4) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus.</i></span>”
These words have been frequently misinterpreted. They
must be viewed in the light of the historical incidents of
the immediately preceding years; and, so read, they present
no difficulties, and leave no room for ambiguity. Their
object was to prevent John from substituting violence
for legal process; from taking the law into his own hands
and “going against them” with an army at his back, or
“sending against them” in similar wise. He must never
again attack <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per vim et arma</i></span> men unjudged and uncondemned.</p>

<p class='c001'>The meaning is plain. Yet Coke, following his vicious
method of assuming the existence, in some part of
Magna Carta, of a warrant for every legal principle
established in his own day, has utterly misled several
generations of commentators. He maintained that what
John promised was to refrain from raising in his own
courts actions in which he was personally interested. In
elaborating this error, he drew a fine distinction between
the court of King’s Bench, otherwise known as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>coram
rege</i></span>, because the king was always in theory present
there, and other courts in which were present only those
to whom he had delegated authority by a writ “sent”
to it. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ibimus</i></span>, he seems to think, applied in the former
case; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mittemus</i></span> in the latter. To quote his own words,
"No man shall be condemned at the king’s suit, either
before the king in his bench, where the pleas are <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>coram
rege</i></span> (and so are the words, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nec super eum ibimus</i></span>, to be
understood) nor before any other commissioner, or judge
whatsoever (and so are the words, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nec super eum mittemus</i></span>,
to be understood), but by the judgment of his peers, that
is, equals, or according to the law of the land."<a id='r829' /><a href='#f829' class='c017'><sup>[829]</sup></a> Coke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>is completely in error; it was the use of brute force,
not merely a limited form of legal process, which John
in these words renounced.</p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>What Classes of Men enjoyed the Protection of
Judicium Parium?</i> No “freeman” was to be molested in
any of the ways specified; but how far in the social scale
did this description descend? Coke claims the villeins as
free for the purposes of this chapter and of chapter I.,
while rejecting them for the purposes of chapter 20.<a id='r830' /><a href='#f830' class='c017'><sup>[830]</sup></a>
His right to the status of a freeman has already been
disallowed,<a id='r831' /><a href='#f831' class='c017'><sup>[831]</sup></a> and any possible ambiguity as to his share
in the benefits of the present chapter is removed by the
deliberate words of the revised version of 1217. Chapter
35 of that reissue, with the object of making its meaning
clearer, inserts after “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>disseisiatur</i></span>” the words (already
discussed) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de libero tenemento suo vel libertatibus vel liberis
consuetudinibus suis</i></span>.” Mr. Prothero suggests that this addition
implies an advance on the privileges secured in
1215:—"It is worth while to notice that the words in
which these liberties are stated in §35 of the charter
of 1217 are considerably fuller and clearer than the
corresponding declaration in the charter of 1215."<a id='r832' /><a href='#f832' class='c017'><sup>[832]</sup></a> It
is safer to infer that no change was here intended, but
merely the removal of ambiguity. If there is a change
it is rather a contraction than an extension, making it
clear that only “free” tenements are protected, and excluding
carefully the property of villeins and even holdings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>villenagium</i></span> (or unfree land) belonging to freemen.<a id='r833' /><a href='#f833' class='c017'><sup>[833]</sup></a>
Care was thus taken to make it plain beyond any reasonable
doubt that no villein should have part or lot in
rights hailed by generations of commentators as the national
heritage of all Englishmen.<a id='r834' /><a href='#f834' class='c017'><sup>[834]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>IV. <i>Reactionary Side of these Provisions.</i> To insist
rigorously that in all cases a judgment of feudal peers,
either in King’s Court or in Court Baron, should take
the place of a judgment by the officials of the Common
Bench and the King’s Bench, was to reverse one of the
outstanding features of the policy of Henry II. In this
respect, the present chapter may be read in connection
with chapter 34. The barons, indeed, were not strict
logicians, and probably thought it prudent to claim more
than they intended to enforce.<a id='r835' /><a href='#f835' class='c017'><sup>[835]</sup></a> Yet a real danger lurked
in these provisions; the clause was, after all allowance
has been made, a reactionary one, tending to the restoration
of feudal privileges and feudal jurisdictions,
inimical alike to the Crown and to the growth of really
popular liberties. John promised that feudal justice (as
before the reforms of his father) should be dispensed in
feudal courts; and, if this promise had been kept, the
result would have been to check the development of the
small committees destined to become at no distant date
the Courts of King’s Bench and Common Pleas, and to revive
the fast-waning jurisdictions of the manorial courts on
the one hand and of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commune concilium</i></span> on the other.<a id='r836' /><a href='#f836' class='c017'><sup>[836]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>V. <i>The Genesis of the Chapter.</i> The interpretation
here given of this famous chapter is emphasized by a
comparison of its words with certain earlier documents
and events. The reigns of Richard and John furnish
abundant examples of the abuses complained of. In
1191 Prince John, as leader of the opposition against
his brother’s Chancellor, William Longchamp, concluded
a treaty protecting himself and his allies from the very
evils which John subsequently committed against his
own barons. The words of this treaty of 1191 admirably
bring out what Richard’s barons sought to secure,
and what they sought to escape. Longchamp conceded
in Richard’s name that the bishops and abbots,
earls and barons, “vavassors” and free-tenants, should
not be disseised of their lands and chattels at the will
of the justices or ministers of the king, but that they
should be dealt with by judgment of the king’s court
according to the lawful customs and assizes, or by the
king’s command.<a id='r837' /><a href='#f837' class='c017'><sup>[837]</sup></a> The magnates were not to be judged
by officials whom they despised as their social inferiors
and mistrusted as the paid instruments of royal tyranny;
their claim to be tried by their equals in the king’s
court was granted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, the main subject of the arbitration, ending in
the treaty from which this excerpt has been taken, was
the custody of certain castles and estates. After the right
to occupy each separate castle in dispute had been carefully
determined, provision was then made, in the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>words cited above, against this arrangement being disturbed
without a judgment of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>curia regis</i></span>. Disseisin,
and particularly disseisin of castles, was thus in 1191,
as in 1215, a topic of special prominence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Early in 1213 the king attempted to take vengeance
upon his opponents in a manner which they are not
likely to have forgotten two years later at Runnymede,
and which probably influenced the wording of the present
chapter. John, resenting bitterly the attitude of the
northern barons who had refused alike to accompany him
to Poitou and to pay scutage, determined to take the law
into his own hands. Without summoning his opponents
before a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commune concilium</i></span> of his feudal tenants, without
even a trial and sentence by one of his Benches, without
making any effort to investigate the justice or injustice
of their pleas for refusing, he set out with an army to
punish them. He had gone as far north as Northampton
on his mission of vengeance when he was overtaken by
the archbishop of Canterbury, a strong advocate of conciliation.
On 28th August, 1213, Stephen Langton persuaded
the king to defer forcible proceedings <em>until he
had obtained a legal sentence</em> in a formal <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curia</i></span>.<a id='r838' /><a href='#f838' class='c017'><sup>[838]</sup></a> That
John once again threatened recourse to violent methods
may be safely inferred from the words of a letter patent
issued in May, 1215, when both sides were armed for
war. He proposed arbitration, and promised a truce
until the arbitrators had given their award. The words
of this promise are notable; since, not only do they
illustrate the procedure of August, 1213, but they agree
closely with the clause of Magna Carta under discussion.
The words are:—“Know that we have conceded to our
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>barons</i></span> who are against us, that we shall not take or disseise
them or their men, nor shall we go against them
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per vim vel per arma</i></span>, unless by the law of our kingdom,
or by the judgment of their peers <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in curia nostra</i></span>.”<a id='r839' /><a href='#f839' class='c017'><sup>[839]</sup></a>
Magna Carta repeats this concession in more general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>terms, substituting “freemen” for the “barons” of the
writ—an alteration which necessitated the omission from
the charter of the concluding words of the writ, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in curia
nostra</i></span>”; because the peers of freemen, other than barons,
would be found, not among the barons in the king’s
court, but among the freeholders in the court baron.<a id='r840' /><a href='#f840' class='c017'><sup>[840]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The words of Magna Carta, taken in connection with
the treaty of 1191 and the writ of 1213, are thus seen to
have a narrower meaning than that extracted from them
by subsequent commentators.</p>

<p class='c001'>VI. <i>Later History of “Judgment of Peers.”</i> The claim
made by the barons at Runnymede was re-asserted in somewhat
varying forms by the same barons or by their descendants
on many subsequent occasions. The “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium parium</i></span>”
was destined to enjoy a long and brilliant career, and the
interpretations put upon it by the Crown and by the
opposition respectively, while interesting in themselves,
afford strong confirmation of the somewhat restricted
estimate of the scope of the present chapter, which has
been above enunciated.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>The baronial contention.</i> The earls and barons,
throughout the reign of John’s unhappy son, attempted
to place a broad interpretation on the privilege secured to
them by this chapter—claiming that all pleas, civil and
criminal (such at least as were raised against them at the
instance of the Crown) should be tried by their fellow earls
and barons, and not by professional judges of lower rank.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>The royal contention.</i> The Crown, on the other
hand, while not openly infringing the charter, tried to
narrow its scope. The judges appointed by the king to
determine pleas <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>coram rege</i></span>, no matter what their original
status might be, became (so the Crown argued) by such
appointment, the peers of any baron or earl. This doctrine
was enunciated in 1233 when Henry III. and his justiciar,
Peter des Roches, denounced Richard, Earl Marshal, as a
traitor, in a meeting (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>colloquium</i></span>) of Crown tenants held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>at Gloucester on 14th August of that year. Thereafter,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>absque judicio curiae suae et parium suorum</i></span>,” as Matthew
Paris carefully relates,<a id='r841' /><a href='#f841' class='c017'><sup>[841]</sup></a> Henry treated earl Richard and his
friends as outlaws, and bestowed their lands on his own
Poitevin favourites. An attempt was made, at a subsequent
meeting held on 9th October, to have these proceedings
reversed on the ground, already stated, that they had taken
place <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>absque judicio parium suorum</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sequel makes clear a point left vague in Matthew’s
narrative: there had been a judgment previous to the
seizure, but only a judgment of Crown officials <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>coram rege</i></span>,
not of earls and barons in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commune concilium</i></span>. The
justiciar defended the action of the government by a
striking argument: “there were no peers in England, such
as were in the kingdom of France,” and, therefore, John
might employ his justices to condemn all ranks of traitors.<a id='r842' /><a href='#f842' class='c017'><sup>[842]</sup></a>
Bishop Peter was here seeking to evade the provisions of
Magna Carta without openly defying them, and his line
of argument was that the king’s professional judges, however
lowly born, were the peers of an English earl or baron.<a id='r843' /><a href='#f843' class='c017'><sup>[843]</sup></a>
Neither the royal view nor the baronial view entirely
prevailed. A distinction, however, must be drawn between
criminal and civil pleas.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Criminal pleas.</i></span> Offenders of the rank of barons
partially made good their claim to a trial by equals; while
all other classes failed. A further distinction is thus
necessary. (<i>a</i>) <i>Crown tenants.</i> The conflicting views held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>by king and baronage here resulted in a compromise. In
criminal pleas, the Crown was obliged to recede from the
high ground taken by Peter des Roches in 1233. Unwillingly,
and with an attempt to disguise the fact of
surrender by confusing the issue, Bracton in theory and
Henry III. in practice admitted part of the barons’ demand,
namely, “that in cases of alleged treason and felony, when
forfeiture or escheat was involved, they should be judged
only by earls and barons.”<a id='r844' /><a href='#f844' class='c017'><sup>[844]</sup></a> This concession was by no
means based on the broad ground taken by the Charter.
Bracton does not admit that the king’s justices were not
“peers” of barons; but deduces their disability from the
narrower consideration that the king, through his officials,
ought not to be judge in his own behalf, since his interests
in escheats might bias his judgment. This is the reason
why, from Bracton’s day to our own, “the privilege of
peers,” which gradually assumed its modern form, has never
extended to misdemeanours, since such convictions never
involved forfeiture or escheat to the Crown.</p>

<p class='c001'>The manner of giving effect to this concession is noteworthy.
The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium parium</i></span> was secured to earls and
barons in later reigns, not merely by giving seats on
the judicial bench to a few holders of “baronies,” but
by bringing the case before the entire body of earls and
barons in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commune concilium</i></span>. What the barons got at
first was “judgment” by peers. The actual “trial” was
the “battle,” the fellow-peers acting as umpires and enforcing
fair play.<a id='r845' /><a href='#f845' class='c017'><sup>[845]</sup></a> Although new modes of procedure came to
prevail, the Court of Peers continued its control, and the
<em>judgment</em> of peers gradually passed into the modern <em>trial</em>
by peers.<a id='r846' /><a href='#f846' class='c017'><sup>[846]</sup></a> The subject has been further complicated by the
gradual growth of the modern conception of a “peerage,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>embracing various grades of “nobles.” In essentials, however,
the rights of a baron (or of any magnate of higher
grade) accused of crime have remained unchanged from the
days of Henry III. to our own. The privilege of “trial by
peers,” whatever the reason underlying it, still extends
to treason and felony, and is still excluded from misdemeanours.
When competent it still takes place before
a "Court of Peers"—namely, the House of Lords if Parliament
is in session, and the Court of the Lord High Steward
if not. Petty offences committed by peers, like those committed
by commoners, come before the ordinary courts of
law. Under these limitations, then, the privilege of a peer
to be tried only in the House of Lords (or in the Court of
the Lord High Steward) has been for centuries a reality
in England for earls and barons, and also for members
of those other ranks of the modern “peerage” unknown in
1215—dukes, marquesses, and viscounts.<a id='r847' /><a href='#f847' class='c017'><sup>[847]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) <i>For tenants of a mesne lord</i>, however, no similar
privilege has been established, even in a restricted form.
In charges of felony, as in those of misdemeanour, all
freemen outside the peerage are tried, and have been tried
for many centuries past, in the ordinary courts of law.
There is no privileged treatment for the knight or the
landed gentleman. All are judged in the same tribunals
and by the same procedure. Private feudal courts never
recovered from the wounds inflicted by Henry II. The
clauses of Magna Carta which sought to revive them were
rendered nugatory by legal fictions or simply by neglect.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <i>Civil pleas.</i> Various attempts were made by the
barons as a class, or by its influential members, to make
good a claim to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium parium</i></span> in civil cases.<a id='r848' /><a href='#f848' class='c017'><sup>[848]</sup></a> The chief
anxiety, perhaps, of the men of 1215 was to save their
estates and castles from disseisin consequent on such pleas.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>Yet the barons’ efforts in this direction were entirely unsuccessful.
The House of Lords (except in cases involving
the dignity or status of a peer) has never claimed to act as
a court of first instance in civil cases to which a peer was a
party. Noble and commoner are here perfectly on a level.
No “peer of the realm” has for many centuries asked to
plead before a special court of his peers in any ordinary
non-criminal litigation, whether affecting his real or his personal
estate.</p>

<p class='c001'>VII. <i>Erroneous Interpretations.</i> The general tendency to
vagueness and exaggeration has already been incidentally
discussed. Two mistakes of unusual persistence require
more detailed notice.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>The identification of</i> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">judicium parium</span> <i>with trial by jury</i>.
The words of the present chapter form the main, if not the
sole, ground on which this traditional error has been based.<a id='r849' /><a href='#f849' class='c017'><sup>[849]</sup></a>
The mistake probably owes its origin to a not unnatural
tendency of later generations of lawyers to explain what
was unfamiliar in the Great Charter by what was familiar
in their own experience. They found nothing in their own
day to correspond with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium parium</i></span> of 1215, so
far at least as affected those who were not Crown tenants;
they found nothing in Magna Carta (unless it were this
clause) to correspond with their own trial by jury: therefore
they identified the two, interpreting the present
chapter as a general guarantee of the right to trial by
jury.<a id='r850' /><a href='#f850' class='c017'><sup>[850]</sup></a> Mr. Reeves, Dr. Gneist, and other writers long ago
exposed this error, but the most conclusive refutations are
those recently given by Prof. Maitland and Mr. Pike.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>The arguments by which these writers prove that “judgment
by peers” is one thing and the “verdict of a jury”
quite a different thing are of a somewhat technical nature;<a id='r851' /><a href='#f851' class='c017'><sup>[851]</sup></a>
but as their importance is far-reaching they must be
explained, however briefly. They seem to be mainly three
in number:</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>a</i>) The criminal petty jury cannot here be intended,
since it had not been invented in 1215:<a id='r852' /><a href='#f852' class='c017'><sup>[852]</sup></a> to introduce trial
by jury into John’s great Charter is an unpardonable
anachronism. (<i>b</i>) The barons would have repudiated trial
by jury if they had known it. They desired (here as in
chapter 21) that all questions affecting them should be
“judged” before fellow barons, and in the normal case, by
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span>. They would have scorned to submit to the
verdict of “twelve good men” of their own locality. Their
inferiors must have no voice in determining their guilt or
innocence. This sentiment was shared by the tenants of
mesne lords. (<i>c</i>) <em>Judgment</em> and <em>verdict</em> were essentially
different. The function of a petty jury (after it <em>had</em> been
invented) was to answer the specific question put to it.
The insurgent barons demanded more than this: they asked
a decision on the whole case.<a id='r853' /><a href='#f853' class='c017'><sup>[853]</sup></a> The “peers” who judged
presided over the proceedings from beginning to end,
appointing the proof they deemed appropriate, sitting as
umpires while its fulfilment was essayed, and giving a final
decision as to success or failure therein.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>Magna Carta and arbitrary commitment.</i> A second
erroneous theory has still to be discussed. The Petition of
Right, as already stated, treats Magna Carta as prohibiting
the Crown from making arrests without a warrant showing
the cause of detention; and the earlier commentators
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>further interpreted it as making all acts of arbitrary imprisonment
by the Crown absolutely illegal, although strong
reasons of state might urge the detention of dangerous
individuals. Hallam, for example, declares that from the era
"of King John’s Charter, it must have been a clear principle of
our institutions that no man can be detained in prison without
trial." Yet every king of England from the days of
John Lackland to those of Charles Stewart, claimed and
exercised the prerogative of summarily committing to gaol
any man suspected of evil designs against the Crown or
Commonwealth. Strong kings used this power freely to
remove those whom they wished to silence. Frequently no
cause of arrest was mentioned, no explanation given, except
the words "by the king’s command." During all these
centuries the legality of such procedure was never challenged
as contrary to Magna Carta, or on any other ground. Even
the famous protest of the judges of Queen Elizabeth,
asserting the existence of legal limits to the royal prerogative
of commitment, proves the lawfulness of the general
practice to which it makes comparatively insignificant
exceptions. Such rights inherent in the Crown, dangerous
undoubtedly to liberty but yet perfectly legal, were never
seriously challenged until the struggle between Charles I.
and his parliaments had fairly begun. Then it was that old
precedents were eagerly sought out and put to new uses.
Then only was it suggested, for the first time, that Magna
Carta was intended to prohibit arbitrary commitments at
the command of the Crown. Such was the argument
deliberately put forth in 1627 during the famous proceedings
known sometimes as Darnell’s case and sometimes
as the case of the Five Knights. Heath, the Attorney-General,
easily repelled this contention: “the law hath
ever allowed this latitude to the king, or his privy council,
which are his representative body, in extraordinary cases to
restrain the persons of such freemen as for reasons of state
they find necessary for a time, without for this present
expressing the causes thereof.”<a id='r854' /><a href='#f854' class='c017'><sup>[854]</sup></a> The parliamentary leaders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>however, too grimly in earnest to be deterred by logic, were
far from abandoning their error because Heath had unanswerably
exposed it. They embodied it, on the contrary,
in the Petition of Right, which condemned the Crown’s
practice of imprisoning political offenders “without any
cause showed” (or only <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per speciale mandatum regis</i></span>) as
contrary to the tenor of Magna Carta—an effective contention
as a political expedient, but essentially unsound in law.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r797'>797</a>. The corresponding provision of the Articles of the Barons (29) adds
the word “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vi</i></span>” (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nec rex eat vel mittat super eum vi</i></span>”). The idea of open
violence, thus clearly indicated, is expressed in contemporary documents
by the fuller phrase, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per vim et arma</i></span>. The accepted translation, as
contained in the <cite>Statutes at Large</cite>, “nor will we pass upon him nor

See also Bigelow, <cite>History of Procedure</cite>, 155, n.: “The expression ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per legem
terrae</i></span>’ simply required judicial proceedings, according to the nature of the
case; the duel, ordeal, or compurgation, in criminal cases, the duel,
witnesses, charters, or recognition in property cases.” The words occur
at least twice in Glanvill, each time apparently with the technical meaning.
In II. c. 19, the penalty for a false verdict includes forfeiture by
jurors of their law (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>legem terrae amittentes</i></span>”); while in V. c. 5, a man born
a villein, though freed by his lord, cannot, to the prejudice of any stranger,
wage his law (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad aliquam legem terrae faciendam</i></span>”). The stress placed
on the accused’s right to the time-honoured forms of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex</i></span> is well illustrated
by the difficulty of substituting jury trial for ordeal. It has already been
shown that the right of “standing mute,” that is, virtually, of demanding
ordeal, was only abolished in 1772. See <i>supra</i>, p. <a href='#Page_400'>400</a>. Five and a half
centuries were thus allowed to pass before the criminal law was bold
enough, in defiance of a fundamental principle of Magna Carta, to deprive
accused men of their “law.”</p>

meanings in this passage. Cf. Gneist, <cite>Engl. Const.</cite>, chapter xviii.
Mr. Pike, <cite>House of Lords</cite>, 170, takes an opposite view: “King John
bound himself in such a manner as to show that judgment of peers was
one thing, the law of the land another. The judgment of peers was
... a very simple matter and well understood at the time. The law
of the land included all legal proceedings, civil or criminal, other than
the judgment of peers.” The present writer rejects this antithesis,
because the two things may be, and indeed must be, combined. The
“trial” by a law and the “judgment” by equals were complementary
of each other. The peers appointed the test and decided whether it
had been properly fulfilled.</p>

maintains, indeed, that the prevention of disseisins “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sine judicio</i></span>”
was the chief, if not the sole, object of the chapter under discussion:—“The
judgment of peers had reference chiefly to the right of landholders
to their lands, or to some matters connected with feudal tenure and its
incidents.” This goes too far: the barons by no means confined the
safeguard afforded by the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium parium</i></span> to questions of land and land-tenure.
Pollock and Maitland, I. 393, countenance a broader interpretation.
One point is beyond doubt: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium parium</i></span> extended to the
assessing of amercements. In c. 21 earls and barons are confirmed in

there is much to be said for that contention), then the reactionary
feudal tendency is even more prominent. This feudal tendency is emphasized

intimate knowledge of the law he administered as justiciar in 1233

</div>

<p class='c001'>This chapter, like the preceding one with which it is
so closely connected, has had much read into it by commentators
which would have astonished its original framers.
The application of modern standards to ancient practice
has resulted in a complete misapprehension. The sums
customarily received by John, as by his predecessors, at
every stage of legal procedure, were not necessarily the
wages of deliberate injustice. This is evident from several
considerations. Thus litigants paid fines for redress against
the Crown itself; in disputes between two private parties,
the sum offered by the highest bidder was by no means
always accepted; sometimes justice was rendered to one
litigant gratis in spite of a heavy offer by the other. Many
payments, then, were not bribes to an unjust judge, but
merely expedients for hastening the law’s delays, or to
ensure a fair hearing for a good plea, or to obtain some
unusual but not unfair expedient, such as a peculiarly potent
writ or the hearing of a case in the exchequer, which would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>ordinarily have been tried elsewhere. If the royal courts
charged higher rates for justice than the feudal courts, they
supplied a better article. When Henry of Anjou threw
open the doors of his court to all freemen who chose to
pay for writs, he found a ready market. These writs
differed widely in price. Some from an early date were
issued whenever applied for (writs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de cursu</i></span>) and at a fixed
sum: others were granted only as marks of favour or after
a bargain had been struck. Specially quick or cogent
procedure had to be specially paid for. It would thus
appear that the system of John was not open to the
unqualified and violent condemnation which it usually
receives. Hallam’s language is too sweeping when he says:
“A law which enacts that justice shall neither be sold,
denied, nor delayed, stamps with infamy that government
under which it had become necessary.”<a id='r855' /><a href='#f855' class='c017'><sup>[855]</sup></a> It was John’s
abuse of the system, not the system itself, which called for
condemnation; and the worst that could be said against it,
according to medieval standards, was that it lent itself too
readily to abuse.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the barons really desired that John should continue to
dispense royal justice in the new fields occupied by his
father, but should do so without pecuniary return, their
demands were unfair and even absurd; but probably they
only wished a strict adherence to the customary rules and
charges which they had come to expect as normal in connection
with royal tribunals. The system, indeed, has many
objectionable features to modern critics; but in the
twentieth century, as in the thirteenth, justice cannot be
had for nothing; and the would-be litigant with a good
claim but a slender purse will be well advised to acquiesce
in a small loss rather than incur the certainty of losing as
much again in extra-judicial outlays, and the risk of losing
many times more in the judicial expenses of a protracted
litigation. The lack of free justice is a reproach which the
men of to-day cannot with good grace fling at the administration
of John.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>As the evils complained of are often exaggerated, so also
are the reforms promised by this chapter of Magna Carta.
John is usually held to have agreed to the abolition of
payments of every sort for judicial writs and other fees
of court. Justice, unlike other valuable commodities, was,
it would appear, to be obtained for nothing—an ideal never
yet attained in any civilized community. A body of highly
trained clerks could not be kept by the king to issue writs
gratuitously to all who asked them, and a staff of judges,
“who knew the law and meant to keep it,” to determine
pleas which would bring in no return to the Crown.</p>

<p class='c001'>The intention of those who framed this chapter was
probably to secure a more moderate and reasonable measure
of reform. Abuses of the system were to be redressed.<a id='r856' /><a href='#f856' class='c017'><sup>[856]</sup></a>
Unfortunately it was not easy to define abuses—to determine
where legitimate payments stopped and illegitimate
ones began. Prohibitive prices ought not to be charged
for writs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de cursu</i></span>; but was the Crown to have no right
to issue writs of grace on its own terms? Plaintiffs who
had any special reason for haste frequently paid to have
their suits heard quickly: was that an abuse?<a id='r857' /><a href='#f857' class='c017'><sup>[857]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever the intention may have been, the practical
effect of the clause was <em>not</em> to secure the abolition of the
sale of writs and justice. The practice under Henry III.
has been described by our highest authority. "Apparently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>there were some writs which could be had for nothing;
for others a mark or a half-mark would be charged, while,
at least during Henry’s early years, there were others
which were only to be had at high prices. We may find
creditors promising the king a quarter or a third of the
debts that they hope to recover. Some distinction seems
to have been taken between necessaries and luxuries. A
royal writ was a necessary for one who was claiming
freehold; it was a luxury for the creditor exacting a
debt, for the local courts were open to him and he could
proceed there without writ. Elaborate glosses overlaid the
king’s promise that he would sell justice to none, for a
line between the price of justice and those mere court
fees, which are demanded even in our own day, is not easily
drawn. That the poor should have their writs for nothing,
was an accepted maxim."<a id='r858' /><a href='#f858' class='c017'><sup>[858]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Probably the practice before and after 1215 showed
few material differences. Some of the more glaring abuses
of the system were checked: that was all.<a id='r859' /><a href='#f859' class='c017'><sup>[859]</sup></a> Parliament in
subsequent reigns had frequently to petition against the
sale of justice in breach of Magna Carta.<a id='r860' /><a href='#f860' class='c017'><sup>[860]</sup></a> The king
usually returned a politic answer, but was careful never
to surrender his right to exact large sums for writs of
grace. Richard II., for example, replied: “Our lord the
king does not intend to divest himself of so great an
advantage, which has been continually in use in Chancery
as well before as after the making of the said charter,
in the time of all his noble progenitors who have been
kings of England.”<a id='r861' /><a href='#f861' class='c017'><sup>[861]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>It is thus evident that Magna Carta did not put down
the practice of charging heavy fees for writs. Yet this
chapter, although so frequently misunderstood and exaggerated,
is still of considerable importance. It marks,
for one thing, a stage in the process by which the king’s
courts gradually outdistanced all rivals. In certain provinces,
at least, royal justice was left in undisputed
possession. In these the grievance was not that there
was too much royal justice, but that it was sometimes
delayed or denied. Here, then, even in the moment of
John’s most bitter humiliation we find evidence of the

<p class='c001'>It is not to such considerations as these, however, that
this chapter owes the prominence usually given to it in
legal treatises; but rather to the fact that it has been
broadly interpreted as a universal guarantee of impartial
justice to high and low; and because when so interpreted
it has become in the hands of patriots in many ages a
powerful weapon in the cause of constitutional freedom.
Viewing it in this light, Coke throws aside his crabbed
learning and concludes with what is rather a rhapsody
than a lawyer’s commentary: “as the gold-finer will not
out of the dust, threads, or shreds of gold, let pass the
least crumb, in respect of the excellency of the metal; so
ought not the learned reader to pass any syllable of this
law, in respect of the excellency of the matter.”<a id='r862' /><a href='#f862' class='c017'><sup>[862]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Merchants and merchandise, like all other classes and
interests, had suffered severely from John’s greed, unrestrained
by regard for the rights of others. The control
of commerce was specially reserved for the king’s
personal supervision. No law or traditional usage trammelled
him in his dealings with foreign merchants, who
were dependent on royal favour, not on the law of the
land, for the privilege of trading and even for personal
safety. No alien merchant could enter England or leave
it, nor take up his abode in any town, nor move from
place to place, nor buy and sell, without paying heavy
tolls to the king. This royal prerogative proved a profitable
one.<a id='r863' /><a href='#f863' class='c017'><sup>[863]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>John increased the number and amount of such exactions,
to the detriment alike of foreign traders and of their
customers. Magna Carta, therefore, sought to restrain
this branch of prerogative, forbidding him to exact excessive
tolls for removing obstacles of his own creating. This
benefited the merchants by securing to them certain rights,
which may perhaps be analysed into three: safe-conduct,
that is protection of their persons and goods from violence;
liberty to buy and sell in time of peace; and a confirmation
of the ancient and just rates of “customs,” with the
abolition of John’s “evil tolls” or additional exactions.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far, the general purport of the enactment is undoubted;
but discussions have arisen on several important
points, such as the nationality of the traders in whose
favour it was conceived; the exact nature of the “evil
tolls” abolished; the motives for the rules enforced; and
the relations between denizens and foreign traders.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>Magna Carta favours alien Merchants.</i> The better
opinion would seem to be that this chapter applied
primarily to foreign traders from friendly states. Attempts
have been made, indeed, to argue otherwise, namely, that
denizens were to benefit equally with strangers, Magna
Carta holding the balance even between them. Such was
the purport of a learned discourse delivered in the
House of Commons by William Hakewill, Barrister of
Lincoln’s Inn, in 1610, during the debate on John Bate’s
case.<a id='r864' /><a href='#f864' class='c017'><sup>[864]</sup></a> His main argument was that certain statutes
of the reign of Edward III.,<a id='r865' /><a href='#f865' class='c017'><sup>[865]</sup></a> in seeking to confirm and
expand the provisions of Magna Carta, did clearly embrace
denizens as well as aliens. Yet the framers of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>Act in the fourteenth century may well have misunderstood
the tenor of John’s Charter, or may have deliberately
altered it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Intrinsic and extrinsic evidences combine to create a
strong presumption that Magna Carta referred chiefly,
perhaps exclusively, to merchants of foreign lands.<a id='r866' /><a href='#f866' class='c017'><sup>[866]</sup></a> Denizens
trading in England did not require those “safe conducts”
which form the chief concession in this chapter;
and their rights of buying and selling were already protected
in another way; for independent traders were
unknown, all merchants being banded into guilds in the
various towns whose privileges (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>omnes libertates et liberas
consuetudines</i></span>”) were guaranteed to them in a previous
part of the great Charter.<a id='r867' /><a href='#f867' class='c017'><sup>[867]</sup></a> It was the alien merchants
who required special protection, since they had, strictly
speaking, no status in the eye of the law, and held their
privileges from the king, who, moving along the line of
least resistance, frequently preferred to overtax them rather
than his own subjects.<a id='r868' /><a href='#f868' class='c017'><sup>[868]</sup></a> The Crown might vouchsafe
the protection they needed either willingly or grudgingly,
and under conditions to be altered at discretion, but
never unless well paid for. The policy of Henry II.
and his sons was to favour merchant strangers, but to
exact in return the highest dues possible, restrained only
by an enlightened self-interest which stopped short at
the point where trade would languish by becoming unprofitable.
The Exchequer Rolls and the Patent Rolls
afford many illustrations of how individual traders or
families made private bargains with the Crown for
trading privileges. In 1181 Henry obtained two falcons
for granting leave to export corn to Norway. In 1197, a
certain Hugo Oisel owed 400 marks for licence to trade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>in England and in Richard’s other lands in time of war as
well as of peace.<a id='r869' /><a href='#f869' class='c017'><sup>[869]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At the commencement of John’s reign, traders resident
in England seem collectively to have obtained confirmation
of their privileges. That king issued Letters Patent to
the Mayor of London, to the magistrates of many smaller
towns, and to the sheriffs of the southern counties of
England, directing them, in terms closely resembling those
of Magna Carta, to allow to all merchants of whatsoever
land safe coming and going, with their wares.<a id='r870' /><a href='#f870' class='c017'><sup>[870]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These arrangements were merely temporary. John did
not intend that any such general grant should prevent him
from exacting further payments from individuals as occasion
offered. For example, Nicolas the Dane promised a
hawk each time he entered England, that he might come
and go and trade “free of all customs which pertain to
the king.”<a id='r871' /><a href='#f871' class='c017'><sup>[871]</sup></a> Such customary dues, at the usual rates,
were not abolished by the Charter, but only the arbitrary
additional payments for which there was no warrant.</p>

<p class='c001'>On this point, then, Magna Carta contained no innovations,
and the same is true of its provision for reprisals
against traders from lands where English merchants were
ill-treated. On the outbreak of war the Charter directs
that merchants of the enemy’s nation should be detained
until the king ascertained how his own subjects were treated
in the enemy’s territory. This is merely declaratory of
the previous practice, of which an illustration may be found
in the terms of a writ of August, 1214, which directed
the bailiffs of Southampton to detain all Flemings and their
goods pending further instructions.<a id='r872' /><a href='#f872' class='c017'><sup>[872]</sup></a> There were thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>precedents for those rules for foreign traders, which have
aroused the admiration of Montesquieu.<a id='r873' /><a href='#f873' class='c017'><sup>[873]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Customs and Tolls.</i> “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Consuetudines</i></span>” is in this passage
used in its narrower financial sense, relating to those
duties on imports and exports which are still specially
called “customs” at the present day, and to various local
dues as well. “Tolls” when not stigmatized as “evil
tolls” would seem to be practically synonymous with these
customs. The Crown had at first taken from the defencelessness
of merchants, whatever, on each occasion, it thought
fit. Practice soon established rules as to the normal rates
considered fair in various circumstances. When a ship-load
of foreign wine arrived, the normal toll was “one cask
from a cargo of ten up to twenty casks, and two casks
from a cargo of twenty or more.”<a id='r874' /><a href='#f874' class='c017'><sup>[874]</sup></a> From other merchandise
a share was claimed of a fifteenth or sometimes a tenth of
the whole. Such tolls, if originally a species of blackmail,
had in John’s day come to be regarded as a legitimate
branch of royal revenue. Any arbitrary increase, however,
was condemned by public opinion, and ultimately by Magna
Carta, as a “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mala tolta</i></span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be remembered, however, that the king was not
the only one who exacted tolls. Every town in England, and
many feudal magnates, by prescriptive usage or by royal
grant, levied payments on all goods bought or sold at
various fairs and markets, or that entered the city gates, or
were unloaded at river wharves, or traversed certain roads.
The ambition of every borough was to increase its own
franchises at the expense of its neighbours. The free customs
of Bristol, for example, meant not only that the men
of that city should have freedom from tolls inflicted by
others, but that they should have the right to inflict tolls
upon those others. A whole network of such customs and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>restrictions impeded the free exchange of commodities in
every part of England. Magna Carta had no intention of
sweeping these away, so far as they were “just and
ancient”; and it is probable that the prohibition against
arbitrary increase of tolls was directed only against the
Crown.</p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>The Motives prompting these Provisions.</i> It has
been not unusual to credit the framers of Magna Carta
with a liberal policy of quite a modern flavour; they are
made free-traders and credited with a knowledge of economic
principles far in advance of their contemporaries.
This is an entire misconception: Englishmen in the beginning
of the thirteenth century had formulated no
far-reaching theories of the rights of the consumer, or the
advantages of the policy of the open door. The home
traders were not consenting parties to this chapter, and
would have bitterly resented any attempt to place foreigners
on an equal footing with the protected guilds of the
English boroughs. The barons, in inserting this stipulation
among the promises wrung from John, acted on their
own initiative and from purely selfish motives. The rich
nobles, both lay and ecclesiastic, desired that nothing
should prevent the foreign rivals of the insular burghers
from importing the wines and rich apparel which England
could not produce. John, indeed, as a consumer of continental
luxuries, partially shared their views, but his
short-sighted policy threatened to strangle foreign trade by
gradually increasing the burdens attached to it, until it
ceased to be remunerative. The barons, therefore, in their
own interests, not in those of the foreign merchants, still
less in those of native traders, demanded that the custom
duties should remain at their old fixed rates. In adopting
this attitude, they showed their selfish indifference to
the equally selfish claims of English traders, who, jealous
of foreigners alike in their home markets and in the
carrying trade, desired a monopoly for themselves. Every
favour shown to foreign merchants was an injury done to
the guilds of the chartered boroughs. This chapter thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>shows a lack of gratitude on the barons’ part for the great
service rendered to their cause by their allies, the citizens
of London. John, on the other hand, would have little
reluctance in punishing the men of his capital who, with
the ink scarce dry on their new municipal charter, had
not scrupled to desert his cause.<a id='r875' /><a href='#f875' class='c017'><sup>[875]</sup></a> It must have been with
grim pleasure that, on 21st July, 1215, in strict conformity
with the tenor of Magna Carta, he addressed a
writ to King Philip inviting reprisals upon London merchants
in France in certain contingencies.<a id='r876' /><a href='#f876' class='c017'><sup>[876]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the reissue of 1216 the privileges conferred on
merchant strangers were confined to such as had not been
“publicly prohibited beforehand.” This was a material
alteration, the effect of which was to restore to the king
full discretionary authority over foreign trade, since he
had only to issue a general proclamation, and then to
accept fines for granting exemption from its operation.</p>

<p class='c001'>IV. <i>English Boroughs and Merchant Strangers.</i> The
quarrel between home and alien traders underwent many
vicissitudes during several succeeding centuries, the Crown
taking now one side, and now the other, as its pecuniary
interests happened to dictate for the moment. No glimmerings
of the doctrine of free trade can be traced: the
merchants of each town, banded in their guilds, directed
their endeavours towards securing rights of exclusive trading
for themselves. It is true that the men of London were
scarcely more jealous of the privileges of the citizens of
Rouen or of Paris than of those of York or of Lincoln;
their ambition was to inflict restrictions upon all rivals
alike. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Liber Custumarum</cite></span>, a compilation of the early
thirteenth century, lays down minute rules for the regulation
of foreign traders in London. The merchant stranger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>had to take up his abode in the house of some citizen.
He was strictly prohibited from engaging in retail trade
and from purchasing articles in process of manufacture.
He could buy only from those who had the freedom of
the city, and could not re-sell the goods within the
borough walls. He was allowed to sell only to burgesses
of London, except on three specified days of the week.
Such were a few of the rules which the Londoners enforced
on all traders within their gates. The king, however,
intermittently encouraged foreigners. Under the fostering
protection of Henry III., Lombards and Provençals
settled in considerable numbers in the capital; and with
the connivance of the king, infringed these rules. When
the Londoners complained, Henry refused relief. Their
loyalty thus shaken, they sided with the king’s opponents
in the Barons’ War, and when the royalist cause triumphed
at Evesham, the capital shared in the punishment meted
out to the Crown’s opponents. Prince Edward in 1266
was nominated protector of foreign merchants in England,
whose cause was temporarily triumphant. At the accession
of that Prince, London bought itself back into
royal favour for the time being. At the same period an
attempt was made to define what tolls or customs might
be taken by the Crown. In 1275, in Edward’s first parliament,
a tariff was fixed by “the prelates, magnates, and
communities at the request of the merchants” on most of
what then formed the staple exports of England: half a
mark on every sack of wool, half a mark on every three
hundred wool-fells (that is, untanned skins with the fleeces
on), and one mark on every load of leather.</p>

<p class='c001'>These were subsequently called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>magna et antiqua custuma</i></span>,
to distinguish them from an additional fifty per
cent., levied from foreign merchants at a later date and
known as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>parva et nova custuma</i></span>. The settlement of 1275
was by no means final. New disputes arose; and in 1285
Edward I. confiscated the liberties of London, suppressed
what he characterized as abuses, and favoured the aliens.
In 1298 the franchises of the capital were restored, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>very soon the abuses complained of began anew. Edward
retorted in 1303 by a special ordinance known as the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>carta mercatoria</i></span> in favour of their foreign rivals, by the
terms of which the provisions of the present chapter of
Magna Carta became at last a reality. This new charter,
which was the result of a bargain struck between the
Crown and the alien traders, conferred various privileges
and exemptions in return for the increased rates of duty
now imposed and known henceforth as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>parva et nova
custuma</i></span>. Edward I. made several attempts to exact the
higher rates from denizens as well as from strangers;
but in this he failed. In 1309 a Petition of Parliament
was presented against the exaction of the “new customs,”
declaring them to be in contravention of Magna Carta.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1311 a temporary community of economic and
political interests resulted in an alliance between the
English merchants and the English baronage, whose combined
efforts forced the “Ordinances” upon Edward II.,
compelling him for a time to reverse his father’s policy
of favouring foreigners at the expense of native merchants.
It is unnecessary to follow the checkered fortunes of these
Ordinances, frequently enforced and as frequently abolished,
according as the fortunes of the barons or of Edward II.
were for the moment in the ascendant. During the reign
of Edward III. the deep-rooted quarrel between home and
alien merchants continued; and many changes of policy
were adopted by the Crown. The statute of 1328 which
abolished the “staples beyond the sea and on this side”
provided “that all merchant strangers and privy may go
and come with their merchandises into England, after the
tenor of the Great Charter.”<a id='r877' /><a href='#f877' class='c017'><sup>[877]</sup></a> Seven years later this was
confirmed by an act which in considerable detail placed
strangers and denizens on an exact equality in all branches
of trade, both wholesale and retail, under the express
declaration that no privileged rights of chartered boroughs
should be allowed to interfere with its enforcement.<a id='r878' /><a href='#f878' class='c017'><sup>[878]</sup></a> While
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>this statute merely repeated and applied the general doctrine
of the present chapter of Magna Carta, it directly
infringed the provisions of chapter 13.<a id='r879' /><a href='#f879' class='c017'><sup>[879]</sup></a> Such sweeping
regulations were in advance of their age and could not
be carried out without revolutionising the entire medieval
scheme of trade and commerce, which depended on merchant
guilds, town charters and local monopolies. The
influence of the English boroughs and their political allies
was strong enough to make the strict enforcement of such
legislation impossible; and later statutes, bowing to the
inevitable, restored the privileges of the boroughs, while
continuing to enunciate an empty general doctrine of free
trade to foreigners.<a id='r880' /><a href='#f880' class='c017'><sup>[880]</sup></a> The English boroughs, to which
Parliament in the reign of Richard II. thus restored their
franchises and monopolies, were able effectually to exclude
foreign competition, in certain trades at least, from within
their walls, for four centuries, until the Statute of 1835
ushered in the modern era of free trade.<a id='r881' /><a href='#f881' class='c017'><sup>[881]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f863'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r863'>863</a>. So far all authorities are agreed, though a difference of opinion exists
as to the source of these prerogatives. Thus (<i>a</i>) Stephen Dowell, <cite>History
of Taxation and Taxes in England</cite>, I. 75, considers that the duties on
imports and exports were in their origin of the nature of voluntary dues
paid by foreign merchants in return for freedom of trade and royal protection;
(<i>b</i>) Hubert Hall, <cite>Customs Revenue of England</cite>, I. 58-62, considers
the prerogative as merely one aspect of purveyance, that is of the right of
the king to requisition what he required for his own needs and those of
his household. Many such “theories” are anachronisms. The prerogative
was founded on fact—on the brute force at the Crown’s disposal. Kings
took what they could, and left future ages to invent theories to justify or
explain their actions.</p>

<p class='c001'>It shall be lawful in future for any one (excepting always
those imprisoned or outlawed in accordance with the law of
the kingdom, and natives of any country at war with us, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>merchants, who shall be treated as is above provided) to
leave our kingdom and to return, safe and secure by land
and water, except for a short period in time of war, on
grounds of public policy—reserving always the allegiance
due to us.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The terms of this permission for free intercourse between
England and foreign lands are peculiarly wide, the
exceptions being reasonable and necessary. Prisoners
obviously could not leave our shores, nor outlaws return
to them: the case of merchants from hostile states had
already been provided for in a liberal spirit; while the
temporary restriction of intercourse with the enemy on
the outbreak of hostilities was eminently reasonable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the provision is thus quite general in its
scope, embracing all classes and ranks of men, it was
peculiarly welcome to the clergy, as enabling them without
a royal permit to proceed to Rome, there to prosecute
their appeals or press their claims for preferment.
Thus considered, it contains a virtual repeal of article 4
of the Constitutions of Clarendon of 1166, which forbade
archbishops, bishops, and parsons (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>personæ</i></span>) of the kingdom
to leave that kingdom without the king’s licence.
The grant of freedom of intercourse in 1215 thus opened
a door for the Church to encroach on the royal prerogative;
and for that reason it was omitted from the
reissue of 1216, never to be replaced. A boon was
thus withdrawn from all classes from fear that it might
be abused by the ecclesiastics. Henry III. took advantage
of the omission in order to restrain the movements
of clergy and laity alike. Those who left the country
without the royal licence had frequently to pay fines.<a id='r882' /><a href='#f882' class='c017'><sup>[882]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>The stringency with which this prerogative was at
first enforced tended, however gradually, to become more
lax. The king still preserved the right, but only exercised
it by means of proclamations over particular classes or on
special occasions, the inference being that all not actually
prohibited were free to come and go as they pleased.
Thus in 1352 Edward III. had it proclaimed throughout
every county of England that no earl, baron, knight,
man of religion, archer, or labourer, should depart the
realm under pain of arrest and imprisonment.<a id='r883' /><a href='#f883' class='c017'><sup>[883]</sup></a> The fact
that Edward found it necessary to issue such an ordinance,
autocratic and abhorrent to modern ideals as its
terms now appear, points to a decrease of royal power,
as compared with that exercised by Henry II., John, or
Henry III. A further curtailment of prerogative may be
inferred from the terms of a Statute of Richard II.,
which, in confirming the king’s power to prohibit free egress
from England, does so, subject to very wide exceptions.
Under its provisions the Crown had the right to prohibit
the embarkation of all manner of people, as well
clerks as others, from every port and other place upon
the sea-coast under pain of forfeiture of all their goods,
"except only the lords and other great men of the realm, and
true and notable merchants, and the king’s soldiers," who
were apparently in 1381 free to leave without the king’s
licence, although earls and barons had been prohibited in
1352.<a id='r884' /><a href='#f884' class='c017'><sup>[884]</sup></a> Even if this statute confers on magnates, merchants,
and soldiers freedom to go abroad without royal
licence (which is doubtful) the powers of veto reserved
to the Crown were still, to modern ideas, excessive. It
remained in force, however, until 1606, when it was
repealed under somewhat peculiar circumstances. After
the union of the crowns, King James, anxious to draw
the bond closer, persuaded his first English parliament to
abrogate a number of old laws inimical to Scottish interests.
It was in this connection that the Act of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>Richard II. was declared (in words, however, not limited
to Scotland) to be “from henceforth utterly repealed.”<a id='r885' /><a href='#f885' class='c017'><sup>[885]</sup></a>
Coke stoutly maintains that this repeal left intact the
Crown’s ancient prerogative, not founded upon statute but
on the common law, of which power the already-cited
Proclamation of Edward III. had been merely an emanation.
He almost seems, therefore, to argue that the
Crown in the seventeenth century retained authority
which extended precisely over those classes mentioned in
the ordinance of 1352.</p>

<p class='c001'>In any view, the prerogative of interfering with the
subject’s freedom to depart from England has never been
completely taken from the Crown. Yet, in the course of
centuries a great change has been gradually effected: the
<em>onus</em> has been shifted from the individual who wished to
leave the kingdom, on to the king who wished to detain
him. While, under John or Henry III., the subject required
before embarking to obtain a licence from the
Crown, under later kings he was free to leave until
actually prohibited by a special royal writ. Coke<a id='r886' /><a href='#f886' class='c017'><sup>[886]</sup></a> speaks
of the form originally used for this purpose, a form so
ancient in his day as to be already obsolete, known as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Breve de securitate invenienda quod se non divertet ad partes
externas sine licentia regis</i></span>. This was superseded by the
simpler writ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ne exeat regno</i></span> which is still in use.<a id='r887' /><a href='#f887' class='c017'><sup>[887]</sup></a> The
sphere of this writ was restricted and altered: it ceased
to be an engine of royal tyranny and was never issued
except as part of the process of a litigation pending in
the Court of Chancery. Regarded always with suspicion
by the courts of common law as a creature of prerogative,
it was for centuries the special instrument which
prevented parties to a suit in equity from withdrawing
to foreign lands. Some uncertainty exists as to the proper
province of these writs at the present day, since the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>Judicature Acts have merged the Court of Chancery in
the High Court of Justice.<a id='r888' /><a href='#f888' class='c017'><sup>[888]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The use of such writs in this restricted sphere could
not be reckoned an oppressive interference with the liberty
of the subject. The perfect freedom to leave the shores
of England and return at pleasure, accorded by John’s
Magna Carta, but immediately withdrawn as impracticable
for that age, has in the course of centuries been fully
realized.<a id='r889' /><a href='#f889' class='c017'><sup>[889]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Two phrases, occurring in this chapter, call for comment,
although for different reasons:—one as embodying
an ancient legal doctrine, now obsolete, the other as anticipating
a characteristically modern point of view. (1)
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Salva fide nostra.</i></span> This short-lived clause of Magna
Carta, in granting freedom to leave the country, very properly
provided that mere absence from England should
absolve no one from allegiance to his king. The old
doctrine of nationality was indeed a very stringent one.
The rule which prevailed was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Nemo potest exuere patriam</i></span>.
Everyone born in the land owed allegiance to its king—and
this tie continued unbroken until severed by the death
of subject or sovereign; it could be broken in no other way.
According to this maxim, a man born a subject of the
king of England must remain his subject wherever he
wandered. A breach of the duties of allegiance, which
were consequent thus on the mere accident of birth, might
expose the offender to the inhuman horrors inflicted upon
traitors.</p>

<p class='c001'>A series of statutes, culminating in the Naturalisation
Act of 1870, have entirely abrogated this ancient doctrine,
and substituted one of perfect liberty. Any native of Great
Britain is now free to become the subject of any foreign
state; and the mere fact of his doing so deliberately and
with all necessary legal formalities, denudes him of his
British nationality, severs the tie of allegiance, and frees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>him from the operation of the law of treason. The words
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>salva fide nostra</i></span>” no longer apply.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Propter communem utilitatem regni.</i></span> The charter, in
placing a restriction on the right of free egress, during the
actual continuance of hostilities, declared that such restriction
was to be imposed for the common good of the
kingdom, thereby enunciating what is generally regarded as
a very modern doctrine: John was to take action, not for
his own selfish ends but only <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro bono publico</i></span>.</p>

if that barony had been in the baron’s hand; and we shall
hold it in the same manner in which the baron held it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This chapter reaffirms a distinction which had been
recognized by Henry II. but ignored by John. Crown
tenants were divided into two classes, according as their
holdings had been originally granted by the Crown, or
by some mesne lord whose barony had subsequently
escheated. The latter class received preferential treatment
from Henry II. for reasons to be immediately explained.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>The older law of escheats was too vague to prove an
effective restraint on royal prerogative; the king, when a
fief had escheated to the Crown, might reckon grants
made by its former owner as void, refusing to acknowledge
as binding upon him the titles of the sub-tenants, treating
all sub-tenancies as wiped out by the mere fact that
their lord’s fief had escheated to the Crown. A mesne
lord, on the contrary, had no similar rights over the sub-tenants
of his tenant who had suffered escheat.</p>

<p class='c001'>The king usually mitigated in practice the full
severity of this theory, confirming as of grace, or from
motives of policy, or in return for money, claims which
he refused to admit as matter of right. The tenants
of escheated baronies were accepted as tenants <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in
capite</i></span> of the Crown.<a id='r890' /><a href='#f890' class='c017'><sup>[890]</sup></a> Not only so; but Henry II.
did not allow them to be prejudicially affected by the
change. The king would only take from them those
services and feudal dues which they had been wont to
render to the lord of the barony previous to its escheat.
This just and lenient policy explains the origin of the
division of royal tenants into two classes; tenants who
held of Henry <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de corona</i></span>, and tenants who held of
him <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de escaeta</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de honore</i></span>, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de baronia</i></span> (phrases
used synonymously).<a id='r891' /><a href='#f891' class='c017'><sup>[891]</sup></a> In respect of such obligations
as were heavier for ordinary Crown tenants than for
tenants of mesne lords, holders of Crown fiefs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de escaeta</i></span>
were placed on the more favoured footing. Two
illustrations may be given. While tenants <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de corona</i></span>
under Henry II. had to pay large and arbitrary reliefs,
those <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de escaeta</i></span> paid no more than 100s. per knight’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>fee.<a id='r892' /><a href='#f892' class='c017'><sup>[892]</sup></a> Nor was their obligation of “suit” (or attendance
at the feudal court of the lord of the fief) to be increased.
“The tenants of any honour or manor which had come
by escheat to the Crown, were not suitors of the Curia
Regis, but of the court of the honour or manor which
had so escheated.”<a id='r893' /><a href='#f893' class='c017'><sup>[893]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John ignored this distinction, extending to tenants <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut
de escaeta</i></span> the more stringent rules applicable to tenants
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de corona</i></span>. Magna Carta reaffirmed the distinction;
and, not content with enunciating a general principle,
made two particular applications of it: neither reliefs nor
services of former tenants of baronies were to be augmented
by reason of the fact that such baronies had escheated to
the Crown.<a id='r894' /><a href='#f894' class='c017'><sup>[894]</sup></a> Henry III.’s Charter of 1217 emphasized a
third application of the general rule, declaring that he
would not, by reason of an escheated barony, claim escheat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>or custody over the sub-tenants of that barony.<a id='r895' /><a href='#f895' class='c017'><sup>[895]</sup></a> To
understand this concession, it must be remembered that
under Henry III., as under Henry II., sub-tenants of
baronies were still liable to have their titles reduced through
the reduction by escheat of the title of their lord; while
sub-tenants of those who were themselves sub-tenants were
not exposed to a similar mischance by the escheat of their
immediate lord. Here also the position of Crown fiefs
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de escaeta</i></span> was to be assimilated to that of fiefs of mesne
lords, and differentiated from that of Crown fiefs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de
corona</i></span>. Sub-tenancies of escheated baronies were not to
be wiped out, but to subsist, and the Crown (or its
grantee) would take the escheat subject to all liabilities
to, and rights of, sub-tenants.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Crown seems not to have strictly observed this
rule in practice. Article 12 of the Petition of the Barons
in 1258<a id='r896' /><a href='#f896' class='c017'><sup>[896]</sup></a> complained that Henry had granted charters
conferring rights which were not his to give (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>aliena jura</i></span>),
but which he had claimed as escheats. An act of the
first year of Edward III. narrated how the Crown had
confiscated from purchasers tenements held of the Crown
“as of honours,” thus treating them “as though they had
been holden in chief of the king, as of the Crown.” Redress
was promised by the statute:<a id='r897' /><a href='#f897' class='c017'><sup>[897]</sup></a> but irregularities
continued throughout the earlier Tudor reigns; and the
first Parliament of Edward VI. passed an act to protect
purchasers of lands appertaining to honours escheated to
the Crown.<a id='r898' /><a href='#f898' class='c017'><sup>[898]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c018' />
<div class='footnote' id='f890'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r890'>890</a>. Royal clemency in this respect could not be relied on by the sub-tenants
of <em>small</em> escheated fiefs (not reckoned as honours or baronies).
This seems to be the opinion of Madox, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Baronia Anglica</cite></span>, 199: “If a fee
holden of the Crown <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in capite</i></span> escheated to the king and was not an
Honour or Barony, then such fee did not (that is to say, I think it did not)
vest in the Crown in the same plight in which it was vested in the said
tenant <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in capite</i></span>.” Cf. also <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ibid.</i></span>, 203.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f891'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r891'>891</a>. See Madox, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Baronia Anglica</cite></span>, 169–171; also Pollock and Maitland, I.

sub-tenants of baronies in wardship (which was analogous to temporary
escheat). For example, when the see of Lincoln was vacant, and therefore
in ward to the Crown in 1168, the heirs of sub-tenants paid to Henry
only what they would have paid to the bishop; one giving £30 for six
fees, and another 30 marks for four. See <cite>Pipe Roll</cite>, 14 Henry II., and
cf. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>supra</i></span>, c. 2. In the matter of scutage, also, a distinction was recognized:
while tenants <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de corona</i></span> might be compelled to serve in person
without an option, crown tenants <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de honore</i></span> (and a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fortiore</i></span> sub-tenants
also) might claim exemption on tendering scutage. See case of Thomas of
Inglethorpe in 12 Edward II., cited by Madox, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Baronia Anglica</cite></span>, 169–171.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f894'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r894'>894</a>. The need for this special reference to relief is not, at first sight,
obvious, since c. 2 of Magna Carta, by forbidding John to exact from
Crown tenants of either class the arbitrary sums taken by his father,
would seem to have already secured them from abuse. Probably, however,
c. 43 sought to prevent John from treating each of the former tenants
of the escheated barony as holder of a new barony of his own, and
therefore liable to a baron’s relief of £100 instead of the £25 he ought
to pay for his five fees, or £50 for his ten fees, or as the case might be.
The case of William Pantol (see <cite>Pipe Roll</cite>, 9 Henry III., cited Madox,
I. 318) seems to illustrate this. He was debited with £100 of relief
for his father’s land, but protested that he held nothing of the Crown
save five knights’ fees of the land which was of Robert of Belesme.
This plea was upheld, and £75 of the amount debited was written
off.</p>

contained a saving Clause: “unless the holder of the escheated barony
held directly of us elsewhere.” Bracton added a second proviso, namely,
unless the said sub-tenants (now Crown tenants <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ut de escaeta</i></span>) had been

</div>

<p class='c001'>These provisions were intended to redress one of the
many abuses connected with the administration of the
oppressive forest laws.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>The Royal Forests.</i> For at least a century before
John’s reign the word “forest” had acquired an exact
technical meaning, and was applied to certain wide districts
scattered irregularly throughout England, reserved
to the Crown for purposes of sport. Here the wild boar
and deer of various species found shelter, in which they
were protected by the severe regulations of the “Forest
Law.” It was the prevalence of this code which absolutely
marked off the districts known as royal forests from
all that lay <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>extra forestam</i></span>; and this made an accurate
definition possible. A “forest” was a district where this
oppressive law prevailed to the absolute exclusion of the
common law which ruled outside. The forests with their
inhabitants had been deliberately omitted from the unifying
process, by which the rest of England had been assimilated
under a uniform <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex terrae</i></span>. They remained in great
measure at the discretion of the Crown. This exclusion
of the common law from the confines of the forests was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>the root from which many evils grew. In no other sphere
was the prerogative so unfettered as within the charmed
circles which marked off these royal preserves from more
fortunate parts of the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this definition of a forest as a <em>legal</em>, not a <em>physical</em>,
entity, it follows that the word is far from synonymous
with terms such as “wood” or “covert,” implying merely
natural characteristics. A forest was not necessarily
covered with trees throughout the whole or even the
greater part of its extent. Miles of moorland and heath
and undulating downs might be included, and even fertile
valleys, with ploughed fields and villages nestling among
them. The same forest, indeed, might contain many woods,
some of them on royal demesne and some the property
of private owners. In certain places the king’s proprietary
rights might be co-extensive with his forestal
rights; but, more frequently, large tracts of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>solum</i></span>
(whether wooded or bare) were owned by freeholders, whose
rights of property tended to become merely nominal, when
overridden by the king’s rights of the chase. Men might
live, and did live, within the boundaries, but they could
enjoy no rights of personal freedom or of property inconsistent
with the rules laid down by the Crown to protect
its own interests. Within the imaginary line the king’s
power was supreme, and he used it frankly for the preservation
of beasts of the chase, not for the good government
of the men who happened to dwell there. These unhappy
beings were absolutely subject to the harsh forest code,
a law, in the expressive words of Dr. Stubbs, “cruel to
man and beast.” If accused of forest offences, they had
no protection from the common law of England any more
than from the law of a foreign land. It was something,
however, that even in these <a id='corr483.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='highplaces'>high places</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_483.33'><ins class='correction' title='highplaces'>high places</ins></a></span> of royal prerogative,
customary rules grew up, obtained authoritative recognition,
and gradually hardened into laws which set some limits,
however inadequate, to royal caprice. Before John’s time
the forest code, as set forth in the Assize of Woodstock,
and exemplified by the practice of forest officials, had taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>its place as a definite system of law distinct from common
law and canon law alike.<a id='r899' /><a href='#f899' class='c017'><sup>[899]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Origin of the Forests.</i> Before the Norman Conquest
the kings of England do not seem to have laid claim to
any exclusive prerogative in this respect. The only
ordinance of Cnut on the subject admitted to be authentic
enacted merely that every man should have his own
hunting, while the king should have his.<a id='r900' /><a href='#f900' class='c017'><sup>[900]</sup></a> The rights of
the Crown, however, were strengthened and consolidated
by the events of 1066, and by the hardening of feudal
theory which followed. All unoccupied waste lands became
royal property; and these were the natural resorts of the
larger sorts of game. The king established a claim to a
preferential, and, at last, to an exclusive, right to hunt
the more important species of animals <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ferae naturae</i></span>, known
as "beasts of the forest"—embracing the red deer (harts
and hinds), the fallow deer (bucks and does), the roe deer
of both sexes, and the wild boar, with, exceptionally in
one forest, the ordinary hare.<a id='r901' /><a href='#f901' class='c017'><sup>[901]</sup></a> The Conqueror and his sons
set great store on their hunting, and warned all intruders
off the wide tracts of land claimed as royal preserves.
Henry I. formulated the doctrine of the forest law, and
it was probably due to him that “forest” acquired its
highly technical meaning. With the special meaning came
the express claim to a monopoly of hunting, together with
supreme and exclusive jurisdiction. The disorders of
Stephen’s reign lowered the Crown’s authority in this
respect as in so much else, and Henry II. found the
forests much curtailed. He had no intention to acquiesce
in this, but it was not till 1184 that he attempted, by
the Assize of Woodstock, to formulate the rules of the
forest law. In this sphere, as in so many others, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>process of organization was completed by Henry II. building
on the foundations laid by his grandfather; and the
whole structure was bequeathed in a state of high
efficiency to his sons. John’s attitude to the forest laws
was not entirely consistent. The monk of Barnwall, whose
work is incorporated by Walter of Coventry in his own,
relates to John’s credit how, in the year 1212, he
attempted, among other reforms meant to propitiate the
people, some relaxations in the severity of the forest code.<a id='r902' /><a href='#f902' class='c017'><sup>[902]</sup></a>
Such clemency was exceptional. More characteristic of
his normal attitude was the order issued on 28th June,
1209, that hedges should be burned and ditches levelled,
so that while men starved, the beasts might fatten upon
the crops and fruits.<a id='r903' /><a href='#f903' class='c017'><sup>[903]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>Forest Officials.</i> The local magistrates who administered
the rest of England were excluded from the
confines of the forests by a separate set of officials. At
the head of this special organization was placed, in early
times, the Forest Justiciar (called the chief forester in
chapter 16 of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Carta de Foresta</i></span>), whose duties were
divided in the year 1238, after which there were two
provinces separated by the river Trent.<a id='r904' /><a href='#f904' class='c017'><sup>[904]</sup></a> His appointment
was permanent, and his duties, which continued between
the eyres, were administrative rather than judicial. He
had discretionary authority to release trespassers imprisoned
for offences against the forest laws.<a id='r905' /><a href='#f905' class='c017'><sup>[905]</sup></a> Under his
general supervision each forest, or group of forests, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>governed by a separate <em>warden</em>, aided by a number of
petty officials known as <em>foresters</em>, whose duties were
analogous to those of a modern gamekeeper, but with
magisterial powers in addition. Wardens were of two
classes—"the one appointed by letters patent under the
great seal, holding office during the king’s pleasure; the
other hereditary wardens."<a id='r906' /><a href='#f906' class='c017'><sup>[906]</sup></a> For the king’s use there was
situated in or near each forest of any extent a royal
residence which, in the Middle Ages, naturally took
the form of a stronghold. It was convenient that the
office of warden should be combined with that of constable
of this neighbouring castle.<a id='r907' /><a href='#f907' class='c017'><sup>[907]</sup></a> “The wardens were the
executive officers of the king in his forests. Writs relating
to the administration of forest business, as well as
to the delivery of presents of venison and wood, were in
general addressed to them.”<a id='r908' /><a href='#f908' class='c017'><sup>[908]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The office was one of authority and of profit, usually
paid in kind rather than by a salary. The warden often
held a fief by a tenure connected with the service, and
enjoyed rights and perquisites always of a valuable nature,
though varying with each forest. These were sufficient to
provide him with an income adequate to his position, and
to allow him to find the wages of his under-keepers, who
ought thus to have been paid officials. Such was the
theory; as matter of fact, the foresters, instead of receiving
wages, gladly paid large sums to the warden, and recouped
themselves, with an ample profit, by extortions from the
humble dwellers in their bailiwicks.<a id='r909' /><a href='#f909' class='c017'><sup>[909]</sup></a> These unpaid foresters
were expressively said “to live upon the country.” They
formed a powerful official class, whose excessive numbers
were a source of constant complaint. They may be
classified in various ways, as, into riding and walking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>foresters (of whom there were one and four respectively
in the normal case), or into foresters nominated by the
wardens, and foresters in fee. These last had vested
interests which the Forest Charter was careful to respect;
as, where chapter 14 reserved to them the right to take
“chiminage,” or way-leave, denied to other types of
foresters; they might still enjoy, but not abuse, the
“vested rights” reserved to them.<a id='r910' /><a href='#f910' class='c017'><sup>[910]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With these professional gamekeepers there co-operated,
in later times at least, several groups of unpaid magistrates
appointed from the knights and freeholders of the district.
Of these honorary officials, whose original function was
to supply supplementary machinery for protecting the rights
of the Crown, but whose position as county gentlemen with
a stake in the district led them also to act to some extent
as arbitrators between the king and outside parties, there
were three recognized kinds. (<i>a</i>) Towards the close of the
twelfth century officers known as <em>verderers</em> (usually four
for each forest) become prominent. They appear in the
<cite>Carta de Foresta</cite> of 1217, but had not been mentioned
in the Assize of Woodstock of 1184. It is probable
that the office was devised in the interval as a check
on the warden’s power, as the office of coroner had been
instituted in the reign of Richard I. as a drag on the sheriff.
In other important respects the duties of the verderers within
the forests resembled those of coroners within the rest of the
county. They were not royal employees, whose whole time
was absorbed by the duties of office and remunerated by
fixed salaries or by perquisites, but rather local landowners
whose magisterial services were unpaid, and were presumably
required only on special occasions. They were responsible
directly to the king, and not to the warden; and were
appointed in the county court, their “election” taking place
in accordance with the terms of the writ “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de viredario
eligendo</i></span>.” They attended the forest courts and swanimotes,
and it appears from chapter 16 of Henry’s forest charter that
it was their duty to bring before the Justices in Eyre lists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>of all offenders indicted in the lower courts. These “rolls
of attachment” were certified by their seals.<a id='r911' /><a href='#f911' class='c017'><sup>[911]</sup></a> (<i>b</i>) The
<em>Regarders</em> were twelve knights appointed in each forest
county to make tours of inspection every third year, finding
answers to a series of questions known as the “Chapters of
the Regard.” In this way they reviewed the Crown’s interests
alike in “the venison and the vert” (the technical
names for game and growing timber respectively), and
reported upon all encroachments: upon hawks and falcons,
bows and arrows, greyhounds and mastiffs (with special
reference to “expeditation” or cutting of their claws),<a id='r912' /><a href='#f912' class='c017'><sup>[912]</sup></a> and
generally upon everything owned by private individuals
likely to harm the beasts of the forest.<a id='r913' /><a href='#f913' class='c017'><sup>[913]</sup></a> (<i>c</i>) The <em>Agistors</em>
are mentioned in the same clause of the Assize of Woodstock
which mentions the Regarders. Four knights were
appointed, apparently by the warden of each forest, whose
duty it was to protect the king’s interests in all matters
connected with the pasturing of swine or cattle within the
royal woods. For thirty days at Michaelmas pigs were turned
loose with liberty to feed on the acorns and beech mast on
payment by their owners of a small fixed sum per head.
The four knights were required to take note of sums thus
due, known as “pannage,” and to collect them at Martinmas.<a id='r914' /><a href='#f914' class='c017'><sup>[914]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mention ought, perhaps, to be made of the private
foresters also, whom owners of woods within the forests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>were obliged to appoint. These “wood wards,” as they
were sometimes called, while paid for by the owner of
the wood, were expected to protect the king’s interests.
In particular, they must prevent trees under their care
from being destroyed or wasted: the king was an interested
party in these, since they formed shelter for his
game.</p>

<p class='c001'>IV. <i>Forest Courts.</i> The judicial side of the forest
system was developed in a manner equally elaborate.
Three sets of tribunals must be distinguished: (1) <cite>The
Court of Attachments</cite> (or “view of attachments”) was a
petty tribunal, the chief duty of which was confined to
taking evidence to be laid in due course before a higher
court. Exceptionally, however, it had power to inflict
fines for small trespasses against the "vert"—namely,
for acts of waste not exceeding the value of fourpence.
It met once in every forty days,<a id='r915' /><a href='#f915' class='c017'><sup>[915]</sup></a> which seems in practice
to have been interpreted as once every six weeks,
the meetings being always held on the same day of the
week.<a id='r916' /><a href='#f916' class='c017'><sup>[916]</sup></a> (2) <i>Courts of Inquisitions.</i> When a serious trespass
against the forest laws was discovered, a special
court was, in early days, summoned immediately to make
investigations. The foresters and verderers conducted
the inquiry, but it was their right and their duty to
assemble the men of the neighbouring townships to help
them. In strictness, apparently, all the inhabitants might
be compelled to attend. In practice, it was sufficient if
four men and the reeve represented each of the four
adjoining villages. Whenever a “beast” was found dead
in the forest twenty men had thus to assemble, to the
neglect of their own affairs; and they would be made
to suffer if they failed to discover the culprit. In one
district at least (Somerton) the definition of beasts of
the chase extended to the ordinary hare; and we read<a id='r917' /><a href='#f917' class='c017'><sup>[917]</sup></a>
how four townships sat in solemn judgment, and found
“that the said hare died of murrain, and that they know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>of nothing else except misadventure,” and how, this verdict
not giving satisfaction, the townships were fined on
the pretext that they were not fully represented. The
real offence was their failure to disclose the culprit, which
was held to imply a desire to shield him. Some alleviation
of the burden of attendance was effected when, at
some date posterior to 1215, <em>special inquisitions</em> were
superseded by one <em>general inquisition</em>, held at regular
intervals (usually every six weeks), to cover all trespasses
committed during the interval. These courts of
inquiry (whether special or general) only “kept” pleas
without “trying” them—that is to say, they received
and recorded accusations, while the judgments were reserved
for the justices. (3) <i>The courts of the forest
justices in eyre.</i> As the smaller courts, in the normal
case, received verdicts and reports, without punishing the
offences reported, it is evident that the whole system
ultimately depended on the justices. Their eyres, however,
were held at wide intervals—apparently once every
seven years during the reign of Henry III. A very
full attendance of forest officials and of the public was
summoned to meet them. The evidence stored up as a
result of the work of the smaller courts, supplemented
by the Rolls of the Regard, was laid before the justices,
who summarily judged “pleas of the vert,” inflicting
small amercements, and “pleas of the venison,” punishing
by imprisonment those previously found guilty, until
they ransomed themselves by heavy fines. These eyres
came to be known as “Courts of Justice Seat,” but not
until long after the reign of John. No juries were present,
nor were they required; the justices punished
offenders who had already been convicted by juries at
a lower court.</p>

<p class='c001'>These three classes of tribunals exercised functions
<a id='corr490.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='analagous'>analogous</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_490.35'><ins class='correction' title='analagous'>analogous</ins></a></span> to those of a modern court of law. In addition,
there should be mentioned two other kinds of
assemblies which performed duties administrative rather
than judicial, as these terms are now understood. (4) The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span><em>regard</em>, held once every three years—not by Crown officials,
but by what was practically a jury of local knights—has
already been referred to. These tours of inspection, sometime
known as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>visitationes nemorum</i></span>,<a id='r918' /><a href='#f918' class='c017'><sup>[918]</sup></a> and sometimes even
as “views of expeditation,” were of great practical importance.
The resulting report was placed before the
justices of eyre as evidence of forest trespasses. (5) Three
times every year, meetings, known from an early date as
“<em>Swanimotes</em>,” were held to regulate the pasturing of swine
and cattle within the royal woods. A fortnight before
Michaelmas the agistors met the foresters and verderers
to provide for the agisting of the king’s woods, a process
which lasted for thirty days—fifteen before and fifteen
after Michaelmas. At Martinmas the agistors collected
the pannage in presence of the same officials. A third
meeting of officials was held in June to make arrangements
for excluding cattle of all kinds from the king’s
woods during the period when the deer were fawning,
but at this the presence of the agistors was not required.<a id='r919' /><a href='#f919' class='c017'><sup>[919]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Carta de Foresta</i></span> applies to these assemblies, and
to none other, the name "Swanimotes"—a word whose
correct use has been the subject of much discussion, and
whose ambiguity was in later centuries the source of many
errors. Its authoritative appearance in 1217 affords
strong evidence of the original sense which it bore. In later
days, however, it was more loosely used, being applied
to inquisitions, and also to courts of attachment. This
has led to much confusion, while its derivation has also
been the subject of discussion. Bishop Stubbs derived
it from the word “swain,” on the supposition that
courts so-called were normally resorted to by the general
body of swains or country people. As matter of fact
(whatever doctrine may be correct philologically), these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>assemblies were connected, not with “swains,” but with
“swine.” The peasantry were specially exempted; whereas
all three meetings sought to regulate the entry or exclusion
of pigs from the woods.</p>

<p class='c001'>V. <i>Chases, Parks, and Warrens.</i> Forests were necessarily
royal monopolies, and must on this and other grounds
be distinguished from three things with which they are apt
to be confused. (1) A “chase” was a district which had
once been a royal forest, but which had, without any formal
act of disafforestation, been granted by the king to a private
individual. The result was to transfer the monopoly of
hunting therein from the Crown to the grantee, while somewhat
modifying the nature of the rights transferred. The
full force of the forest laws was abated, although the extent
and direction of this diminution was nowhere strictly
defined, varying from chase to chase. Such provisions of
the forest law as continued to be binding were no longer
enforced by royal officials and royal courts, but by those of
the magnate, who thus obtained a franchise over the chase
and the royal beasts it contained.<a id='r920' /><a href='#f920' class='c017'><sup>[920]</sup></a> (2) A “park” was any
piece of ground enclosed with a paling, or hedge, whether
with the object of protecting wild beasts or otherwise, and
the right to effect this was quite independent of royal grant.
If the owner of a manor in the near neighbourhood of a
royal forest wished to keep deer of his own, which he might
kill at pleasure, whether for sport or for food, without
infringing the forest laws, he had to stock an enclosure
with beasts legally his own, and to keep them under conditions
which made confusion with the king’s deer impossible.<a id='r921' /><a href='#f921' class='c017'><sup>[921]</sup></a>
In 1234 the barons asserted their right to keep private
gaols for poachers taken in their parks (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in parcis et vivariis
suis</i></span>), but the king refused to allow this.<a id='r922' /><a href='#f922' class='c017'><sup>[922]</sup></a> (3) A “warren,”
which might belong either to the king or to any private
owner, carried with it exclusive rights of hunting within its
bounds all wild animals, except those technically defined as
“beasts of the forest.”<a id='r923' /><a href='#f923' class='c017'><sup>[923]</sup></a> In practice it chiefly embraced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>hares and foxes.<a id='r924' /><a href='#f924' class='c017'><sup>[924]</sup></a> Neither parks nor warrens were protected
by the forest law, but by that part of the common
law which related to theft and trespass. This was, however,
vigorously administered for the preservation of game,
so as to bear with increasing hardship on the common
people, securing a monopoly of hunting to the land-owning
aristocracy, and passing gradually into the modern Game
Laws.<a id='r925' /><a href='#f925' class='c017'><sup>[925]</sup></a> Dr. Stubbs held, apparently, too narrow a conception
of warren when he read it in its modern sense of
“a rabbit warren.”<a id='r926' /><a href='#f926' class='c017'><sup>[926]</sup></a> It was a tract of land wherein exclusive
rights of hunting lesser game (together with rabbits
and other vermin) were preserved to its owner. The king
might, and did, have his warrens and warreners, just as any
subject might; and these royal warreners, like all Crown
officials, great and small, might inflict cruel injustice on the
common people;<a id='r927' /><a href='#f927' class='c017'><sup>[927]</sup></a> but their power of doing harm was less
than that of foresters, as they were dependent on
the common law. The forest code did not apply even
to royal warrens.<a id='r928' /><a href='#f928' class='c017'><sup>[928]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>VI. <i>Forest Rights and Forest Grievances.</i> It is not
difficult to understand the store which the kings of England
set upon their forests. They prized them not merely as a
pleasure ground, but also as a source of revenue. Fines
and amercements, individually small, but amounting to a
large sum in the aggregate, flowed into the Exchequer.
Great as were the pleasure and the profit to the king,
the burden and loss inflicted upon the people, freeholders
and peasantry alike, were greater out of all proportion.
Not only were the best interests of the forest-dwellers
deliberately sacrificed to the royal hunting, not only were
the legal fines swelling the exchequer rendered trebly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>burdensome by the galling and wasteful manner of their
collection; but the men who paid them were the victims of
illegal exactions in addition. These grievances may be
considered under seven heads:—(1) <i>The extent of the forests.</i>
The Crown constantly strove to extend the boundaries; the
people to contract them. The Conqueror and Rufus each
“afforested” wide tracts of land, of which the New Forest is
only one example. In the charter of 1100, Henry bluntly
declared:—“I retain in my hand, by the common consent
of my barons, my forests as my father had them.” This
consent of the magnates, if more than a form and willingly
given, would suggest that the barons were allowed some
share in these royal rights of hunting which led them here
to make common cause with the Crown. Henry, as a
matter of fact, retained not only the forests of his father but
those of Rufus as well, and created new ones of his own.<a id='r929' /><a href='#f929' class='c017'><sup>[929]</sup></a>
Stephen, while retaining the forests of the two Williams,
renounced those added by Henry I. Under Henry II.,
afforestation began anew.<a id='r930' /><a href='#f930' class='c017'><sup>[930]</sup></a> The words of the Great Charter
leave no room to doubt that Henry of Anjou had extended
the boundaries of Stephen’s forests; and that both Richard
and John carried the process further, bringing within the
circle of the cruel law, not only waste and moor, but also
many “woods” belonging to private owners. These royal
encroachments were the more oppressive, occurring as they did
in an age when population was rapidly increasing and seeking
an outlet in the reclamation of waste places on the
debateable land which surrounded the forests. The vagueness
of the frontier aggravated this grievance, as it was often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>difficult for the honest reclaimer of barren land to know
whether he was committing a trespass for which he might
be punished by a crushing fine.<a id='r931' /><a href='#f931' class='c017'><sup>[931]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>The monopoly of hunting.</i> The Crown not only extended
the bounds, but also made the law more stringent.
Such privileges of hunting as the barons had were restricted
as big game became scarce. The Crown’s insistence on a strict
monopoly of the more exciting forms of the chase may not
seem an important grievance, but it was one likely to
exasperate the sport-loving nobles. John, in 1207, admitted
that his barons still retained some vestiges of their right to
share in the hunting of royal beasts.<a id='r932' /><a href='#f932' class='c017'><sup>[932]</sup></a> These rights were
formally recognized and defined in 1217. Chapter 11 of
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Carta de foresta</cite></span> allowed each magnate when passing
through a forest to take one or two beasts at sight of
the foresters, or, if these officials could not be found, then
after blowing a horn to show that nothing underhand
was being done.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <i>Interference with rights of property.</i> Freeholders
whose lands lay in districts which the king was successful
in afforesting, retained their freeholds, but their proprietary
rights lost half their value. They could not root out trees,
to clear their own lands for cultivation; for that was to
commit an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>assart</i></span>. They could not plough up waste land or
pasture (even outside the covert) and turn it into arable,
nor build a mill, nor take marl or lime from pits, nor make
fishponds, nor enclose any space with hedge or paling; for
these acts of ownership were <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>purprestures</i></span>. They could not
destroy a tree or lop off branches (except under stringent
conditions), without being guilty of <em>waste</em>.<a id='r933' /><a href='#f933' class='c017'><sup>[933]</sup></a> They could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>agist their woods until a fortnight after Michaelmas, when
the agisting of the king’s demesnes was over (thus reserving
for him the best market and “pannage dues”).<a id='r934' /><a href='#f934' class='c017'><sup>[934]</sup></a> Heavy
tolls were, under the name of “chiminage,” taken from carts
and sumpter-horses passing through the woods. In all
these and many other ways, rights of private property
in forests were so restricted as to become valueless. The
Great Charter endeavoured to strike at the abuse of these
Crown rights by providing machinery for the abolition
of “evil customs.” The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Carta de foresta</cite></span> entered more into
detail. Not only were past trespasses of all three kinds,—wastes,
purprestures, and assarts to be condoned, but the
law was altered for the future. The long list of purprestures
was materially curtailed: it was made lawful for a
man to construct on his own freehold in the forest, mills,
ponds, lime pits, ditches, and arable lands, provided these
were not placed within the covert (that is in wooded places
fit to shelter game) and did not infringe on any neighbour’s
rights.<a id='r935' /><a href='#f935' class='c017'><sup>[935]</sup></a> They might also keep eyries for breeding falcons
and other birds of prey, and take honey found on their own
ground—rights previously denied to them.<a id='r936' /><a href='#f936' class='c017'><sup>[936]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <i>Interference with the pursuits of the poor.</i> If the rich
suffered injury in their property, the poor suffered in a
more pungent way: stern laws prevented them from
supplying three of their primary needs, food, firewood, and
building materials. On no account could they kill deer;
while difficulties surrounded the taking of timber from
the woods.<a id='r937' /><a href='#f937' class='c017'><sup>[937]</sup></a> It is true that even the Assize of Woodstock
allowed them the privilege of “estovers,” that is of
cutting firewood, but only under stringent rules. All
waste was strictly prohibited; and “waste” was a wide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>word covering, not merely wanton destruction, but all
sales or gifts of logs; while nothing could be taken except
at sight of the forester, whose consent would not be procured
for nothing. This may be illustrated from a period
sixty years later than John’s reign: Hugh of Stratford,
who paid two and a half marks of yearly rent to the
Warden for his post, recouped himself by taking “from
the township of Denshanger for every virgate of land one
quarter of wheat in return for their having paling for
their corn and for collecting dead wood for their fuel in
the demesne wood of the lord king; and from the same
town he took from every house a goose and a hen in
every year.”<a id='r938' /><a href='#f938' class='c017'><sup>[938]</sup></a> A small sum might be taken for every
load of sticks; the men of Somerset complained that
“from the poor they take, from every man who carries
wood upon his back, sixpence.”<a id='r939' /><a href='#f939' class='c017'><sup>[939]</sup></a> Dwellers within or near
the forests were also prohibited from keeping dogs, unless
their value for other pursuits, as well as for hunting, was
destroyed by the removal of three claws of the forefoot.<a id='r940' /><a href='#f940' class='c017'><sup>[940]</sup></a>
Nor could they keep bows or arrows, so necessary for
their protection amid the dangers which beset the inhabitants
of lonely districts throughout the Middle Ages.<a id='r941' /><a href='#f941' class='c017'><sup>[941]</sup></a>
No tanner or bleacher of hides could reside in the forest
districts, unless within the walls of a borough.<a id='r942' /><a href='#f942' class='c017'><sup>[942]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(5) <i>Attendance at forest courts.</i> Unlike the grievances
already mentioned which pressed chiefly on those within
the forests, the burden of performing “suit” at the forest
courts was specially resented by those who lived without.
At every inquisition representatives from neighbouring
townships must be present, while the entire population
were compelled to meet the justices on their forest eyres.
Henry II., whatever may have been the earlier practice,
enforced this duty of attendance upon those outside the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>boundaries as well as on those within. The Assize of Woodstock
admits no exemption for earl or baron, for knight
or freeholder, nor even (according to one version) for
archbishop or bishop. All and sundry must be present
at the eyres. The double duty of doing suit at county
courts and at forest courts meant a double loss of time,
and double risk of amercement. This 11th Article of
the Assize was repealed by chapter 44 of Magna Carta,
which restricted the obligation to denizens of the forests,
a concession confirmed in 1217.<a id='r943' /><a href='#f943' class='c017'><sup>[943]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(6) <i>Fines and punishments.</i> Frequent exactions ground
down the dwellers in the royal forests to abject poverty.
If they failed to attend one of the numerous inquisitions,
they paid a fine. If they failed to disclose the guilty
poacher, they paid a fine. If they gave false information,
they paid a fine. If they sold or gave away timber,
they paid a fine. If they kept grey hounds or mastiffs,
which had not been “lawed,” that is deprived of the requisite
number of claws, they paid a fine.<a id='r944' /><a href='#f944' class='c017'><sup>[944]</sup></a> If a bow or
arrow were found in their keeping, they paid a fine. If they
committed any one of the numerous forms of waste or
trespass, they paid a fine. Truly, the wretched peasant
must walk warily if he would preserve sufficient of his
miserable pittance to keep himself, his wife and children,
in life and health.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Northamptonshire Eyre Roll of 1209 illustrates
how a whole township might suffer severely for no fault
of their own. "The head of a hart recently dead was
found in the wood of Henry Dawney at Maidford by the
king’s foresters. And the forester of the aforesaid Henry
is dead. And because nothing can be ascertained of that
hart, it is ordered that the whole of the aforesaid town
of Maidford be seized into the king’s hand, on the ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>that the said Henry can certify nothing of that hart."<a id='r945' /><a href='#f945' class='c017'><sup>[945]</sup></a>
There was clearly a strong inducement, in such cases, to
find someone guilty.</p>

<p class='c001'>In certain cases Henry II. would not accept a fine, but
inflicted loss of limbs upon violators of the king’s monopoly.
It was often better to kill a fellow-man than a boar or
stag. Article 1 of the Assize of Woodstock announced
that the full rigour of the laws would be enforced, as
under Henry I., while article 12 laid down more definitely
that sureties would only be accepted for two offences.
For the third offence nothing would suffice save the
body of the offender. John’s Magna Carta made no
specific regulation on this head, although the general
provision for abolishing “evil customs” afforded some
relief. Chapter 10 of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Carta de foresta</cite></span> in 1217 conceded
that no one should henceforth lose life or limb
for such offences. The culprit should lie in prison for
year and day, and thereafter find sureties for his future
good behaviour, or failing such sureties be banished from
the realm.</p>

<p class='c001'>(7) <i>Arbitrary government and illegal exactions.</i> If the
laws of Henry’s code were stringent and the legal payments
onerous, it was a worse evil that the law, such
as it was, could be safely defied by the Crown officials,
and that payments of a perfectly illegal nature might
be freely exacted. Within the forest bounds the peasantry
lived in daily fear of the discretionary authority of officials,
whose most unreasonable wishes they dared not oppose.
Sometimes a local tyrant established a veritable reign of
terror. This happened in the forest of Riddlington under
Peter de Neville, as the records of the Rutland Eyre held
in 1269 disclose. One item, taken almost at random
from the long list of his evil deeds, will suffice: “The
same Peter imprisoned Peter, the son of Constantine of
Liddington, for two days and two nights at Allexton,
and bound him with iron chains on suspicion of having
taken a certain rabbit in Eastwood; and the same Peter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>the son of Constantine, gave two pence to the men of
the aforesaid Peter of Neville, who had charge of him, to
permit him to sit upon a certain bench in the gaol of the
same Peter, which is full of water at the bottom.”<a id='r946' /><a href='#f946' class='c017'><sup>[946]</sup></a> In
this evil pit, miscalled a gaol, men illegally arrested on
mere suspicion were allowed to rot or starve to death if
they failed to pay heavy ransoms. Other examples are
only too abundant. In 1225 Norman Samson, a petty
official of the forest of Huntingdon, put men to the torture
without cause, and only released them from their torments
in return for heavy bribes. These petty despots were
practically irresponsible, since the eyres were held at wide
intervals of seven years. Even then the sufferers might
hesitate to complain, fearing a worse fate when the backs of
the justices were turned. If such things could happen after
the grant of the charters of 1215 and 1217, it is not
likely that the foresters were more merciful before. John
was always too indifferent or too busy to redress such
wrongs. The only guarantee against their recurrence in
the future was that honest officials should be selected.
Magna Carta sought to secure this by the provisions of
chapter 45, which (occurring amongst the forest clauses)
directed that no justiciar, sheriff, constable or bailiff should
be appointed, except such as knew the law of the land
and meant to observe it. The word constable included
the wardens, while bailiff was wide enough to embrace
the foresters. It is doubtful whether this clause would
have effected any improvement; it was withdrawn in 1216.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some good must have resulted from chapter 16 of
the Forest Charter, which forbade wardens to hold pleas
of the forest, and reserved them for the justices in eyre.
This prevented wardens from being judges in their own
cause; but their arbitrary acts continued to be plentiful
under Henry III., as has been already shown. Blackmail,
under thin disguises, was levied upon all who would escape
the unwelcome attentions of those in power. Sixty years
after Magna Carta the men of Somerset complained that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>“foresters come with horses at harvest time and collect
every kind of corn in sheaves within the bounds of the
forest and outside near the forest, and then they make
their ale from that collection, and those who do not come
there to drink and do not give money at their will are
sorely punished at their pleas for dead wood, although
the king has no demesne; nor does anyone dare to brew
when the foresters brew, nor to sell ale so long as the
foresters have any kind of ale to sell; and this every
forester does year by year to the great grievance of the
country.”<a id='r947' /><a href='#f947' class='c017'><sup>[947]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Each one of these abuses had been specifically forbidden
by chapter 7 of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Carta de foresta</cite></span>, which had prohibited
the making of “scotale” and the collection of corn, lambs,
and pigs. Such rules were easier to enunciate than to
enforce.</p>

<p class='c001'>VII. <i>Later History of Forests and Forest Laws.</i> The
Forest Charter signally failed to secure a pure administration
of the law; but two processes were at work which
tended to lighten the burdens inflicted. The long struggle
to define accurately the boundaries ended in the reign of
Edward II. in the defeat of the king, who consented to
the frontier being drawn to suit the barons.<a id='r948' /><a href='#f948' class='c017'><sup>[948]</sup></a> Within these
restricted limits, time and the progress of civilization
gradually softened the severity of the forest code, many
customs becoming obsolete.<a id='r949' /><a href='#f949' class='c017'><sup>[949]</sup></a> Charles I. made an ill-judged
attempt to revive some of the Crown’s long-forgotten rights.
Justice-seats were held by the Earl of Holland, accompanied
by amercements and attempts to extend the forest bounds.<a id='r950' /><a href='#f950' class='c017'><sup>[950]</sup></a>
The result was a drastic act of the Long Parliament
limiting them to their old extents.<a id='r951' /><a href='#f951' class='c017'><sup>[951]</sup></a> This statute, however,
abolished neither the forests, the forest laws, nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>the forest courts. After the Restoration a Justice-seat
actually took place <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro forma</i></span> before the Earl of Oxford.
Blackstone declares this to be the last ever held,<a id='r952' /><a href='#f952' class='c017'><sup>[952]</sup></a> although
the offices of justice and warden of the forests were not
abolished till 1817.<a id='r953' /><a href='#f953' class='c017'><sup>[953]</sup></a> The forests, much curtailed in extent,
are still the property of the Crown, though now administered
in the interests of the public by the Commissioners
of Woods and Forests.<a id='r954' /><a href='#f954' class='c017'><sup>[954]</sup></a> The operation of the common
law is, of course, no longer excluded from their confines,
the old antithesis between the forest law and the law of
England being now a thing of the past.<a id='r955' /><a href='#f955' class='c017'><sup>[955]</sup></a></p>

<h3 id='c_45' class='c014'>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE.</h3>

<p class='c016'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nos non faciemus justiciarios, constabularios, vicecomites
vel ballivos, nisi de talibus qui sciant legem regni et eam
bene velint observare.</span></p>

<div class='translate'>

<p class='c001'>We will appoint as justices, constables, sheriffs, or bailiffs
only such as know the law of the realm and mean to observe
it well.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The object of this plainly worded clause was to prevent
the appointment of unsuitable men to responsible offices
under the Crown. The list of officers given is a comprehensive
one—justices, sheriffs, constables and bailiffs—embracing
all royal ministers and agents, both of the
central and of the local government, from the chief justiciar
down to the humblest serjeant.<a id='r956' /><a href='#f956' class='c017'><sup>[956]</sup></a> The clause was directed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>particular against John’s foreign favourites such as the
Poitevin Bishop of Winchester, Peter des Roches,<a id='r957' /><a href='#f957' class='c017'><sup>[957]</sup></a> who had
wielded and abused the authority of chief justiciar in
1214 when the king was abroad, or such as Engelard de
Cygony and the other tools of John’s extortions, stigmatized
by name in a later part of Magna Carta,<a id='r958' /><a href='#f958' class='c017'><sup>[958]</sup></a> who had
filled various posts as sheriffs, wardens, and officials of the
exchequer. Such men had no interests at stake in England,
and little love for its customs and free traditions. In future
John must choose a different type of servants, avoiding all
such unscrupulous men, whether Englishmen or foreigners,
as were ready to break the law in their master’s interests
or their own. There is thus no difficulty in understanding
what class of men were here excluded from office; but what
class were to fill their places? Bishop Stubbs, commenting
on this passage, credits the draftsmen of the Charter with an
intention to secure the appointment of men well versed in
legal science: “on this principle the steward of a court-leet
must be a learned steward.”<a id='r959' /><a href='#f959' class='c017'><sup>[959]</sup></a> The clause of Magna
Carta, however, refers exclusively to royal nominees, not to
the officers appointed by mesne lords to preside over their
feudal courts. The barons appointed their own stewards
and bailiffs, and had no wish to hamper their own freedom
of choice; but only that of the king. Further, it was not
great lawyers whom the barons desired John to employ,
but plain Englishmen with a rough-and-ready knowledge of
insular usage, who would avoid arbitrary acts condemned
by the law of the land. The barons at Runnymede in
1215 desired exactly what the council of St. Albans had
desired on 4th August, 1213, when it issued formal writs
commanding all sheriffs and foresters to observe the laws
of Henry I. and to abstain from unjust exactions;<a id='r960' /><a href='#f960' class='c017'><sup>[960]</sup></a>
and it must be remembered that these laws of Henry
were but the older laws of Edward Confessor slightly
amended.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attitude of John’s barons was the same as that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>Henry’s barons, when the latter declared in 1234 in such
emphatic terms that they did not wish the laws of England
to be changed.<a id='r961' /><a href='#f961' class='c017'><sup>[961]</sup></a> They were far from desiring to be
governed by ministers deeply versed in the science and
literature of jurisprudence, since these would necessarily
have been churchmen and civilians. The laws which the
Crown’s officers must know and observe were the old
customary laws of England, as opposed alike to the canon
law and the civil law of Rome. Honest Englishmen were
wanted, with a reputation for straightforward dealing and
in sympathy with native prejudice. Crown ministers
might do well enough without any academic training in an
age when only one short treatise on the law of England had
been written (that of Glanvill); while the stewards of
court leets, referred to by Bishop Stubbs, might even be
ignorant of the common law, provided they were versed in
“the custom of the manor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This provision of Magna Carta, directed primarily against
alien sheriffs, castellans, and other ministers, disappeared in
1216 (without any comment in the so-called “respiting
clause”), along with several provisions of a temporary
nature, also directed against foreigners. Even if this well-meaning
chapter of John’s Great Charter had remained in
force, it would not have effected much, in the absence of
adequate machinery to ensure its enforcement. In promising
the selection of such ministers as knew the law and
meant to keep it, John remained sole judge of the men
appointed and their intentions. The clause indicated no
standard of fitness to which appeal could be made, no
neutral arbitrator to decide between the fit and the unfit,
and no sanction to enforce compliance on an unwilling
king. Half a century later, the Provisions of Oxford gave
proof of some advance in political theory. They contained
an expedient, crude enough it is true, for constraining
royal officials to keep the law. Forms of the oaths of
office to be taken by castellans and ministers of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>grades were carefully provided.<a id='r962' /><a href='#f962' class='c017'><sup>[962]</sup></a> Even this was only a first
step towards settling a problem which was not completely
solved until, after the struggles of many centuries, the
modern doctrine of ministerial responsibility was firmly
established.</p>

<h3 id='c_46' class='c014'>CHAPTER FORTY-SIX.</h3>

<p class='c016'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnes barones qui fundaverunt abbatias, unde habent
cartas regum Anglie, vel antiquam tenuram, habeant earum
custodiam cum vacaverint, sicut habere debent.</span></p>

<div class='translate'>

<p class='c001'>All barons who have founded abbeys, concerning which
they hold charters from the kings of England, or of which
they have long-continued possession, shall have the wardship
of them, when vacant, as they ought to have.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The religious houses of the various orders, (abbeys,
priories, and convents), which had increased so rapidly in
number since the reign of Henry I., fell naturally into two
classes according as they had been founded by the king or
by private individuals. The king or the great baron, in
bestowing lands on a religious foundation, reserved, either
expressly or by implication, certain valuable rights of
property, of which the control over the election of the abbot
or prior, together with the wardship of the fief during
vacancies, were the most important. King John, while by
his separate charter to the clergy he had renounced
in favour of all churches and monasteries, cathedral and
conventual, all control over election of prelates, had carefully
reserved his rights of wardship; and the barons
insisted that the proprietary rights of mesne lords who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>founded religious houses, should also be respected. John
however, wherever he had any plausible pretext, usurped
the wardship over private foundations, in addition to his
own. It would appear from the terms of a later chapter,<a id='r963' /><a href='#f963' class='c017'><sup>[963]</sup></a>
that in 1215 the Crown actually held in ward certain
abbeys founded by mesne lords, for provision is there made
for their restoration. The present chapter looks to the
future, forbidding new usurpations of this nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the reissues of the Charter certain verbal changes
occur, but it is not clear that they imply any changes of
substance. In 1216 the words “and as it has been above
declared” were added, implying that the rights of mesne
lords were to be restricted by the rules previously laid
down in chapter 5, as to wardship—rules especially applied
to the lands of bishoprics and religious houses in 1216 by a
clause which had no parallel in John’s charter.<a id='r964' /><a href='#f964' class='c017'><sup>[964]</sup></a> In 1217
three other small changes tend to widen the scope of the
clause. The “barons who have founded abbeys” of John’s
grant become “the patrons of abbeys”; royal “charters”
become more explicitly “charters of advowson”; “ancient
tenure” is expanded into “ancient tenure or possession.”<a id='r965' /><a href='#f965' class='c017'><sup>[965]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Is it possible that the influence of the Church was
powerful enough at Runnymede to prohibit all mention of
lay “patrons” and lay presentations or “advowsons”;
whereas it was powerless to prevent the barons pressing
their rights of patronage two years later? John’s promise
of free canonical election<a id='r966' /><a href='#f966' class='c017'><sup>[966]</sup></a> had interfered with royal patronage,
and Stephen Langton would be unwilling to admit a
subject’s claim to rights which he had forced the Crown to
renounce. The question of lay patronage, indeed, was not
directly raised in any version of Magna Carta; but prior to
1215 John seems to have interfered between abbeys and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>their founders. On 16th August, 1200 he granted to
William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, the privilege of
bestowing the pastoral staff of Nuthlegh Abbey, which lay
within that nobleman’s fief; this shows that John
forbade appointments without royal licence.<a id='r967' /><a href='#f967' class='c017'><sup>[967]</sup></a> The present
chapter of Magna Carta made little difference in practice.
Henry III. claimed wardship over abbeys and priories
formed by earls and barons on their own fiefs, and kept them
vacant, by preventing their patrons making appointments
without his licence.<a id='r968' /><a href='#f968' class='c017'><sup>[968]</sup></a></p>

<h3 id='c_47' class='c014'>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN.</h3>

<p class='c016'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnes foreste que afforestate sunt tempore nostro, statim
deafforestentur; et ita fiat de ripariis que per nos tempore
nostro posite sunt in defenso.</span></p>

<div class='translate'>

<p class='c001'>All forests that have been made such in our time shall
forthwith be disafforested; and a similar course shall be
followed with regard to river-banks that have been placed
“in defence” by us in our time.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>An analogy may be traced between the royal prerogatives
of hunting and of falconry here brought together. William
the Conqueror claimed wide and ill-defined rights to “afforest”
whole districts at his discretion, and in one well-known
instance at least, the creation of the New Forest,
he made good his claim, at the cost of much suffering
to his humbler subjects. Large tracts of land were thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>consecrated to the wild boar and the stag. The king
claimed somewhat similar powers for protecting his preferential
rights of fowling. If woods could be “afforested”
for hunting, rivers might be placed “in defence” for hawking.
The parallel must not be pushed too far. River-banks
were preserved only for such limited period as was covered
by the king’s express command; and although wardens
were appointed to guard them,<a id='r969' /><a href='#f969' class='c017'><sup>[969]</sup></a> the Crown never established
such absolute control over the banks of rivers as
it did within districts declared “afforested.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The provision of the present chapter, defining what
river-banks might be “defended,” disappeared, together with
the relative clause of chapter 48 (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ripariis et earum custodibus</i></span>”),
from the reissue of 1216; but, in the respiting
clause there was promised further deliberation, which
resulted in its replacement in chapter 20 of the final
version of Magna Carta.<a id='r970' /><a href='#f970' class='c017'><sup>[970]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>More attention is usually paid to the bearing of the
present chapter upon the limits of the forests. John, if he
had created no new forests, had at least extended the
boundaries of the old ones. All such encroachments are
to be immediately given up. This summary redress, which
implies that John’s aggressions were so notorious as to
admit of no dispute, should be contrasted with the more
judicial procedure appointed by chapter 53 for determining
encroachments made by Henry II. and Richard I.
A somewhat similar distinction is also to be found in
the corresponding provisions of the Forest Charter of
1217 (chapters 1 and 3); but the line is there differently
drawn. Chapter 1 of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Carta de foresta</cite></span> extends
the summary methods of redress to the disafforesting of all
forests created by Richard as well as those created by
John. The terms of the later document are also more
detailed, making more explicit the meaning of the earlier
grant. Both seem to be directed against encroachments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>on the rights of landowners, affording no protection to the
poor. While they deny the Crown’s right to afforest private
woods “to the damage of any one” (that is, of barons or
freeholders owning them), they admit the legality of past
acts, whether of Henry, of Richard, or of John, in afforesting
Crown lands, subject always to a saving clause in
favour of freeholders in right of common of pasturage.<a id='r971' /><a href='#f971' class='c017'><sup>[971]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Even if Henry III. had cordially co-operated with his
barons to disafforest all tracts of ground afforested by
Henry II. and his sons, difficulties of definition would still
have made the task tedious. As it was, struggles to settle
the boundaries embittered the relations between Crown and
Parliament, until the very close of Edward Plantagenet’s
reign. Only the leading steps in the slow process by
which the opposition triumphed need here be mentioned.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the issue of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Carta de foresta</cite></span> on 6th November,
1217,<a id='r972' /><a href='#f972' class='c017'><sup>[972]</sup></a> machinery was set in motion, in obedience to its
terms, to ascertain the old boundaries and to disafforest all
recent additions. The work of redress continued for some
years, suffering no interruption from the issue of the new
royal seal at Michaelmas, 1218.<a id='r973' /><a href='#f973' class='c017'><sup>[973]</sup></a> In face of many difficulties
only slow progress was possible. More strenuous
efforts followed the reissue of the Charters on 11th February,
1225;<a id='r974' /><a href='#f974' class='c017'><sup>[974]</sup></a> for, five days later, justices were appointed
to make new perambulations, which resulted in the disafforestation
of wide tracts. Henry considered himself, and
with some reason, as unjustly treated by these justices,
or by the local juries on whose verdicts they had relied.
After he had proclaimed himself of age in January, 1227,
he challenged their findings; and this has been misinterpreted
as an attempt to annul the Forest Charter.<a id='r975' /><a href='#f975' class='c017'><sup>[975]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Some of the knights who had perambulated the forests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>were persuaded or coerced into acknowledging that they
had made mistakes; and, after further inquiry, Henry
restored the wider bounds. His reactionary measures went
on for two years; but thereafter the frontiers were fixed,
in spite of many complaints, until strong pressure compelled
Edward I., towards the close of his reign, to reopen
the whole question. Perambulations in 1277 and
1279 produced apparently no results. Renewed complaints
were followed by new perambulations in 1299-1300,
the reports of which were laid before a Parliament
which met at Lincoln on 25th January, 1301. The
king, as the result of hostile forces converging from several
sides, had to surrender; and on 14th February he confirmed
the Forest Charter, and formally agreed to the
reduced boundaries as defined by the most recent inquests.
Edward had acted under constraint: on this plea he subsequently
obtained from Pope Clement V. a bull, dated
29th December, 1305, revoking all the concessions made
at Lincoln.<a id='r976' /><a href='#f976' class='c017'><sup>[976]</sup></a> The Crown seemed thus to triumph once
more; but the barons refused to accept defeat, forcing
upon Edward II. the acceptance of the narrower bounds
as they had been defined at his father’s Parliament in 1301.
This settlement was confirmed by statute in the first year
of the reign of Edward III.,<a id='r977' /><a href='#f977' class='c017'><sup>[977]</sup></a> and that king failed in all
attempts to escape from its provisions. Thus the authoritative
pronouncement made in 1301 by the Parliament of
Lincoln furnished the basis on which the protracted controversy
was finally determined.<a id='r978' /><a href='#f978' class='c017'><sup>[978]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The further history of the forest boundaries may be told
in a few sentences. No changes were made until the
sixteenth century. When Henry VIII. afforested the districts
surrounding Hampton Court in 1540, he did so by
consent of Parliament, and on condition of compensating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>all those who suffered damage. The same course was
followed by Charles I. in creating the Forest of Richmond
in 1634. Finally, as a result of the attempts of the Stewarts
to revive obsolete forest rights, a statute of the Long
Parliament, reciting the Act of 1327, “ordained that the
old perambulation of the forest in the time of King
Edward the First should be thenceforth holden in like
form as it was then ridden and bounded.”<a id='r979' /><a href='#f979' class='c017'><sup>[979]</sup></a></p>

forty days of the said inquest, be utterly abolished, so as
never to be restored, provided always that we previously
have intimation thereof, or our justiciar, if we should not

</div>

<p class='c001'>This chapter is mainly, though not exclusively, a forest
one. It provides in a sweeping and drastic manner for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>the abolition of “evil customs,” three groups of which are
specially emphasized: (<i>a</i>) those connected with forests
and warrens (presumably royal warrens only), with their
officials; (<i>b</i>) those connected with sheriffs and their subordinates;
and (<i>c</i>) those connected with river-banks and their
guardians. The word “customs” is obviously here used
in its wider sense, embracing all usages and procedure,
whether specially connected with pecuniary exactions or
not.<a id='r981' /><a href='#f981' class='c017'><sup>[981]</sup></a> The word “evil” is not defined, but here (in
favourable contrast to elsewhere) machinery is provided for
arriving at a definition. This takes the form of a new
application of the useful <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inquisitio</i></span>. In each county a
local jury of twelve knights was to be immediately
chosen by “the good people” of that county, and these
twelve received a mandate to hold a comprehensive
inquest into “evil customs” generally. All practices
condemned by them (after hearing on oath smaller
local juries, doubtless) were to be abolished within
forty days of the inquiry, “so that they shall never be
restored.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At the end of the chapter appears a proviso that, before
actual abolition, notice must be sent to the king, or, in
his absence, to his justiciar. Although such intimation
was absolutely necessary, both on grounds of policy and
of ordinary courtesy, it would appear that this clause was
inserted only at the instance of the king’s friends; at
least, it is written (as an afterthought) at the foot of two
of the copies of the Great Charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whether acting under pressure or from grounds of
policy, John lost no time in instituting the machinery
necessary for effecting this part of the reforms. On the
very day on which the terms of peace were finally concluded
between king and barons at Runnymede, namely,
on 19th June, 1215, he began the issue of writs to
sheriffs, warreners, and river bailiffs. Within a few days
every one of these had been certified of the settlement
arrived at, and had received commands to have twelve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>knights chosen by the county in the first county court,
who should make sworn inquest into evil customs.<a id='r982' /><a href='#f982' class='c017'><sup>[982]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These orders were obeyed: knights were appointed in
the various counties, who seem to have taken a liberal
view of their own functions. Far from confining themselves
to declaring customs to be evil, or even to seeing
them abolished, they claimed to share with the sheriffs
the exercise of the entire executive authority of the
county. Some warrant for these pretensions may be
found in the terms of a second series of writs issued in
the king’s name on 27th June and following days. These
were addressed to the sheriff and the twelve knights
jointly, commanding them to make instant seizure of all
who refused to take, as required in the previous writs,
the oath of obedience to the twenty-five executors of the
Charter.<a id='r983' /><a href='#f983' class='c017'><sup>[983]</sup></a> The revolutionary committee of the central
government had thus in each county local agents in the
twelve knights whose original duties had been to see evil
customs abolished.</p>

<p class='c001'>The hatred which all classes bore to the forest laws
is well illustrated by the iconoclastic spirit in which these
knights concurred with the jurors of each small district,
and with all others concerned, for the drastic treatment
of abuses. Moderate-minded men began to fear that these
sweeping changes would virtually abolish the royal forests
altogether (in their technical legal sense). Accordingly, the
leading prelates, who were in large measure responsible for
inducing the king to make truce at Runnymede, and were
thus under a moral obligation to do what they could to
prevent the barons breaking faith, issued a written protest.
They declared that the chapter in question must
be understood by both parties “as limited,” and “that
all those customs shall remain, without which the forests
cannot be preserved.”<a id='r984' /><a href='#f984' class='c017'><sup>[984]</sup></a> Clearly, the whole code of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>forest laws was in danger of being swept out of existence,
as forming one huge “evil custom.” What effect, if any,
this protest had, is not known. The country was soon
plunged in civil war, during the continuance of which
neither side had leisure for the reform of abuses, however
urgently required. In 1216 the subject was one of those
“respited” for future consideration, and in 1217 an attempt
was made to specify in detail those evil customs which
were to be abolished. The dangerous experiment of leaving
such definition to local juries in each district was not
repeated.</p>

<p class='c016'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnes obsides et cartas statim reddemus que liberate

<div class='translate'>

<p class='c001'>We will immediately restore all hostages and charters
delivered to us by Englishmen, as sureties of the peace or
of faithful service.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>A feature of John’s system of government was the
constant demand for hostages as guarantees of his subjects’
loyalty. Such an expedient was, indeed, naturally resorted
to in the Middle Ages upon special occasions, as, for example,
to secure the observance of a recent treaty, or
where the leaders of a rebellion, newly suppressed, had
been spared on condition of future good behaviour. Thus
the Conqueror, in 1067, during a forced absence from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>England immediately after its acquisition, took with him
Edgar Atheling and the Earls Morkere and Eadwin; and
many other instances readily occur. Such cases were,
however, exceptional, until John established an unfortunate
claim to distinction as the only king of England who ever
resorted to such a policy, not merely in face of danger,
but as a constant and normal practice in times of peace.
It may be that his continual suspicions were well grounded;
but this scarcely excuses them, since it was his own bad
government which goaded his subjects into a condition of
perpetual unrest.</p>

<p class='c001'>John lived in his native England like a foreign conqueror
in the midst of a hostile race, keeping sons and
daughters in his clutches to answer for their parents’
attempts at revolt. This ingenious but unfair practice
accords well with what we know of John’s character and
general policy. It was a measure of almost devilish
cunning for obtaining his immediate aim, but likely to
recoil on himself whenever a critical state of his fortunes
arrived. Its efficacy lay in this, that it forced the
hand of discontented magnates, compelling them to decide
upon the instant between the desperate expedient of open
rebellion and the delivery of their children to an unscrupulous
enemy, thus renouncing, perhaps for ever, the
possibility of resistance or revenge, thereafter to be purchased
at too dear a price—the life of the hostage. By
thus paralyzing his enemies one by one, John hoped to
render disaffection innocuous. Those nobles whom the
tyrant did not thus control through their tenderest affections
were too few for effective resistance. At the slightest
show of temper, they, too, were suddenly pounced upon
for hostages, thus joining the ranks of those who dared
not rebel.<a id='r985' /><a href='#f985' class='c017'><sup>[985]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The entire history of the reign shows of what excessive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>practical importance this question of hostages had become.
It abounds with examples of the varied pretexts upon
which John demanded them, and of his drastic methods
of visiting upon their heads the sins of those who had
pledged them. Thus, in 1201, John seized the castles of
certain of his barons; and one of them, William of Albini,
only saved his stronghold of Belvoir by handing over his
son as a hostage.<a id='r986' /><a href='#f986' class='c017'><sup>[986]</sup></a> In the same year, the men of York
offended the king by omitting to meet him in procession
when he visited their city, and by their failure to
provide quarters for the billeting of his archers. The
king, as usual, demanded hostages, but ultimately allowed
the citizens to escape on payment of £100 to buy back
the king’s goodwill.<a id='r987' /><a href='#f987' class='c017'><sup>[987]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Hardly a year passed without similar instances; but,
apparently, it was not until 1208 that the practice was
enforced wholesale. In that year the king’s abject fear
of the effects of the Pope’s absolution of his barons from
their allegiance led to his demand that every leading man
in England should hand over his sons, nephews, or other
blood relations to the king’s messengers.<a id='r988' /><a href='#f988' class='c017'><sup>[988]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The danger of failure to comply with such demands is
illustrated by the fate of Maud of Saint-Valery, wife of
William de Braose, who refused point-blank to hand over
her grandchildren to a king who, she was unwise enough to
say, “had murdered his captive nephew.”<a id='r989' /><a href='#f989' class='c017'><sup>[989]</sup></a> Two years later
John, after failing to extort enormous sums in name of
fines, caused her, with her eldest son, to be starved to death,
a fate to which her own imprudence had doubtless contributed.<a id='r990' /><a href='#f990' class='c017'><sup>[990]</sup></a>
John’s drastic methods of treating his hostages
may also be illustrated from the chronicles of his reign, for
example, from the fate of the youths he brought from
Wales in June, 1211. When he heard of the Welsh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>rebellion of the following year, he ordered his levies to
meet him at Nottingham. On his arrival, at the
muster, early in September, John found awaiting him a
great concourse, who were treated to an object lesson
which long might haunt their dreams. His passion at
white heat, John incontinently hanged eight-and-twenty
defenceless boys of the noblest blood of Wales.<a id='r991' /><a href='#f991' class='c017'><sup>[991]</sup></a> This
ghastly spectacle could not have been forgotten by
any one then present, when later in the same month
the king, in the throes of sudden panic, fled to London;
and, secure in the fastnesses of the tower, demanded
hostages wholesale from all the nobles whose fidelity he
doubted. The inveterate Eustace de Vesci and Robert
fitz Walter preferred to seek safety in flight, the only alternative
open to them.<a id='r992' /><a href='#f992' class='c017'><sup>[992]</sup></a> The others, with the Nottingham
horror fresh in their memories, were constrained to hand
over, with feelings that may be conceived, their sons and
daughters to the tender mercies of John, cunning and cruel
by nature, and rendered doubly treacherous by suspicion
intensified by fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>The defects of this policy, in the long run, may be read
in the events which preceded Magna Carta. When John’s
hold on the hostages was relaxed, because of his preparations
for the campaign of 1214, ending as it did in utter
discomfiture, the disaffected were afforded their long-desired
opportunity, and were stimulated to rapid action by the
thought that such a chance might never occur again.
John, on his return, held comparatively few hostages, and
the northern barons saw that they must act, if at all,
before their children were once more in the tyrant’s
clutches.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even in June, 1215, John had control over a few
hostages, and the chapter now under discussion demands
the immediate restoration of those of English birth (the
Welsh receiving separate treatment) together with the
charters which John held as additional security, very much
as a creditor might hold the titles of a mortgaged property.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>This provision of Magna Carta was immediately carried
out. Letters were dispatched to the custodians of royal
hostages, ordering an immediate release.<a id='r993' /><a href='#f993' class='c017'><sup>[993]</sup></a> The practice of
taking hostages, however, by no means ended with the
granting of the Great Charter. Before a year had run,
some of the insurgent nobles, repenting of their boldness,
succeeded in making terms with John by the payment of
large sums of money and the delivery of their sons and
daughters in security for their future loyalty. Simon fitz
Walter, for example, thus gave up his daughter Matilda.<a id='r994' /><a href='#f994' class='c017'><sup>[994]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r985'>985</a>. The only magnates not exposed to this dilemma were the prelates,
whose celibacy cut them adrift from family ties. They had no hostages

personal violence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Chapter 45 sought to secure the appointment of suitable
men to posts of trust under the Crown; the present chapter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>definitely excludes from bailiwicks (a comprehensive term
embracing all grades of local magistracies) one particular
group of royal favourites. Their names prove them of
foreign extraction. They had come from Brabant, Flanders,
and Poitou,<a id='r995' /><a href='#f995' class='c017'><sup>[995]</sup></a> and several of them stayed on in England and
held lucrative posts under Henry III. in spite of the ban
here laid upon them. The clause of John’s Charter which
excluded them from office was indeed omitted from future
reissues, along with chapter 45.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reasons which had rendered them obnoxious to the
barons are not explained, but may be readily imagined.
They had filled the unpopular posts of collectors of customs,
wardens of forests, and commanders of royal garrisons, and
had distinguished themselves by their unscrupulous zeal in
pushing the king’s prerogatives connected with trade,
castles, forests, and purveyance.</p>

<p class='c001'>The career of Engelard de Cygony may be taken as
typical of the rest. He was a nephew of Gerard de Athyes,<a id='r996' /><a href='#f996' class='c017'><sup>[996]</sup></a>
and was deep in the confidence of his master, as is proved
by the number of responsible offices with which he was
entrusted. We know that in 1211 he acted as Sheriff of
Gloucester, since he accounted to the Exchequer for the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma
comitatus</i></span>. He further accounted for the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma burgi</i></span> of
Bristol,<a id='r997' /><a href='#f997' class='c017'><sup>[997]</sup></a> which seems to imply interference with the chartered
liberties of that city. It was probably because John
required his services elsewhere, that some of his sheriff’s
duties were performed by deputy, a burgess named Richard
rendering accounts on his behalf. Engelard also held pleas
of the Crown for Gloucestershire, in violation alike of the
ordinance of 1194 forbidding any sheriff to act as justiciar
in his own county, and of the customary rule (confirmed
only, not originated, by chapter 24 of Magna Carta) which
prevented sheriffs from holding pleas of the Crown.<a id='r998' /><a href='#f998' class='c017'><sup>[998]</sup></a> Several
entries tell of barrels of wine which he took as “prise”
from ships entering the port of Bristol. For example, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>exchequer officials allowed him to deduct from the amount
which he owed as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma</i></span>, the sum of 60s., in respect of four

which suggests that he had purchased from the Crown the
profits yielded by the prerogative of taking prise; and had
then resold to the king the hogsheads actually required for
the royal use at 15s. each. Engelard also guarded a rich
treasure for the king at Bristol, probably as constable of
the castle there, sums being paid to him <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad ponendum in

custody of more than 10,000 marks of the king’s money.<a id='r1001' /><a href='#f1001' class='c017'><sup>[1001]</sup></a>
Hostages, as well as bullion, were placed under his care; a
writ dated 18th December, 1214, directed him to liberate
three noble Welshmen whom it mentioned by name.<a id='r1002' /><a href='#f1002' class='c017'><sup>[1002]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the civil war to which the treaty of peace sealed at
Runnymede was a prelude, Engelard, then constable of
Windsor Castle and warden of the adjacent forest of
Odiham, proved active in John’s service. He successfully
defended Windsor from the French faction, making vigorous
sorties until relieved by the king.<a id='r1003' /><a href='#f1003' class='c017'><sup>[1003]</sup></a> He requisitioned
supplies to meet the royal needs; and a plea was brought
against him so long afterwards as 1232, in connection with
twelve hogsheads of wine thus taken.<a id='r1004' /><a href='#f1004' class='c017'><sup>[1004]</sup></a> He acted as
sheriff of Surrey under William Marshal, the Regent, but
was suspended from this office in 1218 in consequence of
a dispute with Earl Warenne.<a id='r1005' /><a href='#f1005' class='c017'><sup>[1005]</sup></a> He remained warden of
the castle and forests for twenty years after the accession
of Henry III.,<a id='r1006' /><a href='#f1006' class='c017'><sup>[1006]</sup></a> and his long services were rewarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>with grants of land: in the county of Oxford he held the
manor of Benzinton, with four hundreds and a half, during
the king’s good pleasure;<a id='r1007' /><a href='#f1007' class='c017'><sup>[1007]</sup></a> while his son Oliver received the
lucrative post of guardian over the lands and heirs of
Henry de Berkley.<a id='r1008' /><a href='#f1008' class='c017'><sup>[1008]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In 1221, however, acting in consort with Falkes de
Bréauté, Philip Mark, and other castellans, Engelard supported
earl William of Aumâle in his resistance to the
demands of Henry’s ministers, that all royal castles should
be restored to the king. Notwithstanding the secrecy
with which he sent men to the earl at Biham castle,<a id='r1009' /><a href='#f1009' class='c017'><sup>[1009]</sup></a> he
fell under suspicion of treason, and escaped imprisonment
only on finding hostages that he would hold the castle of
Windsor for the king, and surrender it at his will.<a id='r1010' /><a href='#f1010' class='c017'><sup>[1010]</sup></a> In
1236, he was relieved of some of his offices, but not of all,
for in 1254 he was two years in arrears with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>firma</i></span> of
the manor of Odiham.<a id='r1011' /><a href='#f1011' class='c017'><sup>[1011]</sup></a> In that year, apparently, he died;
for the patent roll contains a writ granting him permission
to make his will, and an entry in 1255 relates how “for
good service done to the king by Engelard de Cygony
in his lifetime, the king granted to his executors that they
should be quit of all accounts to be rendered by them at
the exchequer, and of all averages of accounts, and of all
debts and imposts.”<a id='r1012' /><a href='#f1012' class='c017'><sup>[1012]</sup></a> Engelard thus died, as he had lived,
the trusted servant and favourite of kings. His career
illustrates how the very same men who had incurred odium
as the partizans of John became, when the civil war was
over, the instruments of his son’s misgovernment.<a id='r1013' /><a href='#f1013' class='c017'><sup>[1013]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John here binds himself to disband his foreign troops,
who had acted as the agents of his tyrannies, keeping the
native English in subjection, and ever ready to take the
field in the event of rebellion. These men, who had garrisoned
the royal castles which formed such formidable
engines of oppression in the Middle Ages, are now to be
banished “as soon as peace is restored,” an indication that,
even at the date of Magna Carta, a state of virtual war
was recognized. This promise was partially fulfilled. On
23rd June writs were issued for the disbandment of the
mercenaries.<a id='r1014' /><a href='#f1014' class='c017'><sup>[1014]</sup></a> The renewal of the civil war, however, was
followed by the enrolment of new bands of foreigners on

we return from our expedition (or if perchance we desist from
the expedition) we will immediately grant full justice therein.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The Charter here reverts to a topic of vital interest
to the barons, the subject of illegal disseisins already
raised in chapter 39, which is here supplemented. Legal
remedy is provided for everyone dispossessed by the
Crown “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sine legali judicio parium suorum</i></span>.” A distinction
is drawn, however, between two classes of
wrongs, according as they have been inflicted by John himself,
where summary methods are to rule, or by his predecessors,
where less precipitate procedure must take its
course.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Articles of the Barons had recognized the same
distinction, while providing somewhat different treatment.
Those disseised by Henry or Richard were to get redress
"according to the judgment of their peers in the king’s court";
those disseised by John, “according to the judgment of
the twenty-five barons,” that is, of the executors, to be
afterwards more fully discussed. Both cases, however,
were in the Articles qualified by a stipulation which calls
for comment. John had taken the crusader’s vow a few
months previous, and now claimed the usual three years’
“respite” allowed to those preparing for the holy war, from
all legal proceedings against them. The barons, viewing
John’s vow as a deliberate and notorious perjury, rejected
his claim. The point was referred by the Articles of the
Barons to arbitration. The prelates, whose <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judicium</i></span> on
this point was declared to be final (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>appellatione remota</i></span>”),
and who were bound to give an early decision (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad certum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>diem</i></span>”), might not unreasonably have been suspected of
partiality, since “taking the cross” was not a step to be
belittled by churchmen. Yet they seem to have acted
in a spirit of not unfair compromise, if the clause as it
finally appeared in John’s Magna Carta may be taken as
giving the substance of their award.</p>

<p class='c001'>The crusader’s privilege was not allowed by Langton
and his fellow-arbitrators in cases where John himself had
been the disseisor; the twenty-five executors might there
decide forthwith. Respite was allowed, however, in respect
of the disseisins of Henry and of Richard (except where legal
proceedings were already pending).<a id='r1017' /><a href='#f1017' class='c017'><sup>[1017]</sup></a> The Charter says
nothing of the procedure to be adopted at the close of
the three years; but there was probably no intention to
depart from the terms of the Articles in this respect,
namely, "judgment of peers in the king’s court."</p>

<p class='c001'>John had good reason to consider as unfair the mode
here appointed for deciding disputes as to disseisins effected
by him. Many delicate points would thus be referred to
the summary decision of a baronial committee, sure to be
composed of his most bitter enemies—the very men, perhaps,
whom he had dispossessed. If the “judgment of the
twenty-five” meant for the barons “the judgment of peers,”
it meant for the king the judgment of inferiors and enemies.<a id='r1018' /><a href='#f1018' class='c017'><sup>[1018]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The object of this chapter was to find a remedy for
what the barons evidently considered an unfair advantage
enjoyed by women appellants, who were allowed to appoint
some champion to act for them in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duellum</i></span>, while the
accused man had to fight for himself. The connection
between appeal and battle, and the distinction between
battle following on appeal and battle on a writ of right,
have already been explained.<a id='r1021' /><a href='#f1021' class='c017'><sup>[1021]</sup></a> In civil pleas wherein combat
was legally competent, neither party could fight in
person: champions were insisted on, although <em>hired</em> champions
were condemned. In theory, these men were witnesses,
each swearing that he had actually seen the seisin—that is,
had been present at the infeftment of the claimant whose
title he supported, or at that of his ancestor from whom he
inherited the land.<a id='r1022' /><a href='#f1022' class='c017'><sup>[1022]</sup></a> In criminal pleas, on the other
hand, the parties must fight in their own persons. This
distinction is not so illogical as it seems at first sight, for
the appellant was supposed to be an eye-witness of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>crime<a id='r1023' /><a href='#f1023' class='c017'><sup>[1023]</sup></a>; and the apparent anomaly disappears when both
rules of procedure are treated as deductions from the
principle that the combatants in all cases were witnesses
whose conflicting testimonies must be weighed in the
balance of battle, with an overruling Providence holding
the scales.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a case of murder, no private accuser would be heard
unless he alleged that he had seen the accused actually
do the deed. The stringency of this rule was, however,
modified by legal fictions. The near relation, or the
feudal lord, of the slain man was treated as constructively
present at his slaying, because of the closeness of the
bond of blood or of homage between the two. This, at
least, is the most plausible interpretation of Glanvill’s
words: “No one is admissible to prove the accusation
unless he be allied in blood to the deceased or be connected
with him by the tie of homage or lordship, <em>so that</em>
he can speak of the death upon testimony of his own
sight.”<a id='r1024' /><a href='#f1024' class='c017'><sup>[1024]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The rule also which required an appellant to offer proof
by his own body was relaxed in certain cases; women,
men over sixty years of age, and those with broken bones
or who had lost a limb, an ear, a nose, or an eye, were
unable to fight effectively, and might therefore appear by
proxy.<a id='r1025' /><a href='#f1025' class='c017'><sup>[1025]</sup></a> The privilege thus accorded to women was
looked on with much disfavour as conferring an unfair
advantage as against appellees who were not allowed
to produce a substitute. Accordingly an option was
given the man accused by a woman; he might, in
Glanvill’s words, elect either "to abide by the woman’s
proof or to purge himself by the ordeal."<a id='r1026' /><a href='#f1026' class='c017'><sup>[1026]</sup></a> This option
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>was freely used; an appellee in 1201 was allowed to
go to the ordeal of water,<a id='r1027' /><a href='#f1027' class='c017'><sup>[1027]</sup></a> while two years later when
the widow of a murdered man offered to prove her accusation
“as the court shall consider,” the accused was allowed
to go to the ordeal, “for he has elected to bear the iron.”<a id='r1028' /><a href='#f1028' class='c017'><sup>[1028]</sup></a>
After the virtual abolition of ordeal in 1215, appeals by
women were usually determined <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per patriam</i></span> (that is by
the sworn verdict of a jury of neighbours). Such is the
doctrine of Bracton,<a id='r1029' /><a href='#f1029' class='c017'><sup>[1029]</sup></a> whose authority is amply borne out
by recorded cases. Thus in 1221, a man accused by a
woman of her husband’s murder offered fifteen marks for
a verdict of the jurors.<a id='r1030' /><a href='#f1030' class='c017'><sup>[1030]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A woman’s right of accusation (even when thus safeguarded
from abuse) was restricted to two occasions, the
murder of her husband and the rape of her own person.
Magna Carta mentions only one of these two grounds of
appeal; but silence on the subject of assault need not be
interpreted as indicating any intention to deprive women of
their rights in such cases.<a id='r1031' /><a href='#f1031' class='c017'><sup>[1031]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The present chapter of the Great Charter confines
itself to appeals of murder, declaring that no woman
has the right to institute proceedings in this way for
the death of father, son, or friend, but only for
that of her husband. Hard as this rule may seem, the
barons here made no change on existing law. Glanvill
does not seem to recognize the possibility of a woman’s
appeal of homicide save for the death of her husband.<a id='r1032' /><a href='#f1032' class='c017'><sup>[1032]</sup></a>
He seems to deduce the reason for allowing it in that
case from the principle already explained: "A woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>is heard in this suit accusing anyone of her husband’s
death, if she speak as being an eye-witness to the fact,
because husband and wife are one flesh"—another example
of constructive presence.<a id='r1033' /><a href='#f1033' class='c017'><sup>[1033]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There seems to be no authority whatever for Coke’s
hasty inference from the provisions of this chapter, that
previous to 1215 a woman had an appeal for the death of
any one of her “ancestors.”<a id='r1034' /><a href='#f1034' class='c017'><sup>[1034]</sup></a> The chapter, in spite of its
declaratory nature, seems an ungallant one, indicating that
the barons were more careful to guard themselves against
unnecessary risk than to champion the cause of defenceless
women.<a id='r1035' /><a href='#f1035' class='c017'><sup>[1035]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The thirty-seventh of the Articles of the Barons, forming
the draft of this chapter, refers specially to one
particular class of illegal fines, namely those exacted by
John from defenceless widows in return for being allowed
the peaceful enjoyment of their legal rights of property in
their own and their husband’s estates (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro dotibus, maritagiis,
et hereditatibus</i></span>”). It forms thus a natural supplement
to chapter 7. The earlier chapter had confirmed widows
in their rights for the future; this one remits fines
unjustly taken in the past. It is probable that even the
clause of the Articles of the Barons did not intend to
limit its own operation to this one group of unjust fines;
and it mentions amercements, without any qualification.
In any view, the terms of Magna Carta were broadened out
to embrace illegal fines and amercements of every sort.<a id='r1036' /><a href='#f1036' class='c017'><sup>[1036]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>The distinction between fines and amercements, absolute
in theory but tending to become obliterated in practice,
has been explained in a former chapter.<a id='r1037' /><a href='#f1037' class='c017'><sup>[1037]</sup></a> The system of
arbitrary fines, always so galling a feature in the Crown’s
policy throughout the Middle Ages, culminated in the reign
of John, whose talents were well suited to the development
of its ingenious and mean details. Dr. Stubbs describes
the product of his labours as “the system of fines which
was elaborated into that minute and grotesque instrument
of torture which all the historians of the reign have
dwelt on in great detail.”<a id='r1038' /><a href='#f1038' class='c017'><sup>[1038]</sup></a> Hallam commented on this
in a passage which has become classical. "The bishop of
Winchester paid a ton of good wine for not reminding
the king (John) to give a girdle to the countess of Albemarle;
and Robert de Vaux five best palfreys, that the
same king might hold his peace about Henry Pinel’s wife.
Another paid four marks for leave to eat (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro licentia
comedendi</i></span>)."<a id='r1039' /><a href='#f1039' class='c017'><sup>[1039]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Unique procedure was provided by the present chapter
for deciding disputes as to the legality of fines and
amercements. Authority to decide was vested in a board
of arbitrators to consist of thirteen or more of the twenty-five
executors, together with Stephen Langton and such
others as he chose to summon. No mention is made of the
maximum number whom the primate might thus nominate,
and there is no attempt to define their powers relative
to those of the other members of the board, a somewhat
unbusinesslike omission, but one which testifies to the
great confidence placed in Langton by those who approved
its terms. Care is taken to prevent such members of
the twenty-five as were likely to be biased from sitting
in judgments on suits like their own—a stipulation which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>might with advantage have been extended to several
other chapters.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we have disseised or removed Welshmen from lands
or liberties, or other things, without the legal judgment of
their peers in England or in Wales, they shall be immediately
restored to them; and if a dispute arise over this,
then let it be decided in the marches by the judgment of
their peers; for tenements in England according to the
law of England, for tenements in Wales according to the
law of Wales, and for tenements in the marches according
to the law of the marches. Welshmen shall do the same
to us and ours.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This is the first of three chapters directed towards redressing
wrongs suffered by Welshmen: and the three
taken together testify to the importance attached by the
barons to the value of the Welsh alliance. Restoration
is to be made (<i>a</i>) of illegal disseisins effected by John
(chapter 56); (<i>b</i>) of those effected by Henry II. and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>Richard I. (chapter 57); and (<i>c</i>) of hostages and charters
delivered to John as pledges of peace (chapter 58).</p>

<p class='c001'>The present chapter does for Welshmen what the first
part of chapter <a href='#c_52'>52</a> had already done for Englishmen. The
reasons for treating Welshmen separately were probably
twofold, partly for the sake of emphasis, and partly because
some slight differences of detail were required.
“Judgment of peers,” indeed, was applied to both cases,
but for the dispossessed Welshmen, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in marchia per
judicium parium suorum</i></span>” takes the place of the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per
judicium viginti quinque baronum</i></span>” provided for Englishmen
in like case. The “venue” was thus apparently
fixed in the marchland for all Welshmen’s cases, although
three different kinds of law were to be applied according
to the situation of the property in dispute. This clear
indication of the existence of three distinct bodies of law,
one for England, another for Wales, and a third for the
marches, shows that the unifying task of the common
law had not yet been completed. Interesting questions
of a nature analogous to those treated by the branch of
modern jurisprudence known as International Private Law
must constantly have arisen. The “peers” of a Welshman
were not defined; but a court composed of Welsh
barons or freeholders was probably meant.</p>

<p class='c001'>The final words of the chapter, declaring that Welshmen
were to afford reciprocal redress to John and his
subjects, are interesting, since they imply that Welshmen
had, in some cases, successfully seized lands claimed by
Englishmen. Here, as usual, the barons were mainly interested
in securing their own rights.</p>

the Cottonian versions, (cf. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>supra</i></span>, 195, n.); but their omission from their
proper place is clearly a clerical error, since they appear <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in situ</i></span> in the

words, “in accordance with the laws of the Welsh in
relation to the aforesaid districts,” indicating the three
systems of law referred to in the previous chapter. No
machinery is here specified for declaring or applying that
law; the need for this indeed had been rendered remote
by John’s success before the arbitrators who determined

Since then, new hostages, including Llywelyn’s own son,
had been handed over; and charters also had apparently
been pledged. John now promised unconditionally to restore
all of these; and the Welsh Prince must have
breathed more freely when this was fulfilled, allowing him,
his son by his side, with a light heart to prepare for the
hostilities against the English Crown, long seen to be
inevitable and now to be resumed in alliance with the

<p class='c001'>The Articles of the Barons had to some extent treated

<p class='c001'>A heterogeneous body of forces was drawn into temporary
union by common hatred of John. The barons welcomed
allies whether from Wales or from Scotland; if the
three preceding chapters were a bid for Llywelyn’s support,
this one was dictated by a desire to conciliate Alexander.
John was forced to promise to restore to the king of Scots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>his sisters and other hostages, together with his franchises
and his “right.” This last word covered Alexander’s claim
to independence and also whatever title he might prove
good to various English fiefs which he claimed to hold under
the English Crown.</p>

<p class='c001'>Opinions have been, and still are, sharply divided as
to whether, or in what degree, Scotland was subject to
feudal overlordship. Of one fact there can be no doubt;
David I. and his successors, kings of Scotland, had been wont
to do fealty and homage to the kings of England; but this fact
has received widely different interpretations. Such homage,
it is argued, was performed in respect of certain English
baronies which happened to belong by hereditary right to
the kings of Scotland, namely, the earldom of Huntingdon,
the isolated position of which enabled the English Crown
without danger to admit the claim, and the counties of
Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland, the proximity
of which to the border rendered their possession by a
Scottish prince a source of weakness to England.<a id='r1045' /><a href='#f1045' class='c017'><sup>[1045]</sup></a> The
terms in which the oath of homage was taken did not
indicate for what fiefs it was sworn—whether for the
English earldoms alone, or for the whole country north
of Tweed as well.</p>

<p class='c001'>The position of the kings of Scots remained ambiguous
in this respect, until William the Lion was placed at a
terrible disadvantage by his capture at Alnwick in 1174,
after supporting the rebellion against Henry II. To gain
his release he ratified the Treaty of Falaise on 8th December,
of that year, by which he agreed in future to hold
all his territories as fiefs of the English Crown. All his
tenants in Scotland were to take a direct oath to Henry;
while hostages were surrendered along with the castles of
Berwick, Roxburgh, Jedburgh, Edinburgh, and Stirling.<a id='r1046' /><a href='#f1046' class='c017'><sup>[1046]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>This notable achievement of Henry’s diplomacy was, like
other portions of his life’s work, undone by his successor.
Richard, preparing for his crusade of 1190, sold recklessly
every right that would fetch a price: William bought back
the independence of his ancient kingdom; but this restoration
of the relations that had prevailed previous to 1174,
involved a restoration of all the old ambiguities. When
Richard died, William despatched ambassadors to England,
pressing his claims upon the northern counties, promising
to support John’s title in return for their admission, and
adding threats.<a id='r1047' /><a href='#f1047' class='c017'><sup>[1047]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>John avoided committing himself to a definite answer
until his position in England was assured; thereafter he
commanded William to do homage unconditionally. The
Scots king disregarded the first summons, but yielded to
a second, taking the oath in public on the summit of
the hill of Lincoln, on 21st November, 1200, “reserving
always his own right.”<a id='r1048' /><a href='#f1048' class='c017'><sup>[1048]</sup></a> The saving clause left everything
vague as before.</p>

<p class='c001'>In April, 1209, the king of Scots incurred John’s displeasure
by sheltering bishops who had supported the policy
of Rome in the matter of the interdict. William’s only
son, Alexander, was demanded as a hostage, or alternatively
three border castles must be delivered up. After a refusal,
the old king gave in on 7th August, 1209.<a id='r1049' /><a href='#f1049' class='c017'><sup>[1049]</sup></a> Alexander did
homage on behalf of his father “for the aforesaid castles
and other lands which he held,” and found sureties for the
payment of 15,000 marks. William’s daughters, Margaret
and Isabel (the two ladies referred to in Magna Carta)
became the wards of John, who had the right to bestow
them in marriage—stipulations which come suspiciously
near an admission of feudal vassalage.<a id='r1050' /><a href='#f1050' class='c017'><sup>[1050]</sup></a> There seems, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>to have been some understanding that one of them
should wed John’s eldest son.<a id='r1051' /><a href='#f1051' class='c017'><sup>[1051]</sup></a> Margaret and Isabel,
though kept virtually as prisoners in Corfe Castle, Dorset,
were yet honourably and kindly treated there. The
Close Rolls of the reign contain several entries (which read
strangely enough among the sterner memorials of John’s
diplomacy) containing orders for supplying them with
articles of comfort and luxury. Thus on 6th July, 1213,
John, busy as he must have been with affairs of state,
instructed the Mayor of Winchester to despatch in haste for
the use of his niece Eleanor and of the two Scots princesses
robes of dark green (tunics and super-tunics) with capes of
cambric and fur of miniver, together with twenty-three yards
of good linen cloth, with light shoes for summer wear, “and
the Mayor is to come himself with all the above articles to
Corfe, there to receive the money for the cost of the same.”<a id='r1052' /><a href='#f1052' class='c017'><sup>[1052]</sup></a>
Margaret and Isabel had no reason to complain of such
treatment, whatever thoughts the Mayor of Winchester may
have had of so liberal an interpretation of his civic
duties.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, events in Scotland had favoured English
pretensions. In the year 1212, William, now in advanced
age, although his son was still a stripling, was compelled by
internal troubles to appeal for aid to John. Cuthred,
a claimant for the Scottish throne as a descendant of
Donald Bane MacWilliam, having acquired a considerable
following in Scotland, endeavoured to dethrone King
William; and his attempt seemed likely to succeed, when
English succour was asked and paid for by a Treaty signed
at Norham on 7th February, 1212. By this, William
granted to John the right to marry the young Alexander,
then fourteen years of age, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sicut hominem suum ligium</i></span>,” to
whomsoever he would, at any time within the next six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>years, but always "without disparagement"—a phrase already
explained.<a id='r1053' /><a href='#f1053' class='c017'><sup>[1053]</sup></a> William further pledged himself and his
son to keep faith and allegiance to John’s son, Henry, “as
their liege lord” against all mortals.<a id='r1054' /><a href='#f1054' class='c017'><sup>[1054]</sup></a> The young Scottish
prince thereafter journeyed southwards in the train of John,
by whom he was knighted on the 4th of March at London.
In June an English army entered Scotland; the pretender
was defeated and killed. William had saved his Crown,
but his independence was impaired. Scotland was gradually
sinking into the position of a vassal state. This was
recognized at Rome. On 28th October, 1213, Innocent III.,
among other healing measures consequent on John’s surrender
of his kingdom, ordered the king of Scotland and his
son to show fealty and devotion to John, in terms similar
to those addressed to the English barons.<a id='r1055' /><a href='#f1055' class='c017'><sup>[1055]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>William the Lion died at Stirling on 4th December,
1214, and Alexander was crowned at Scone two days
later,<a id='r1056' /><a href='#f1056' class='c017'><sup>[1056]</sup></a> his peaceful succession being facilitated by the
knowledge that he had the support of John. On 28th
April, 1215, the English king, already deep in his quarrel
with the barons, acknowledged receipt of Thomas Colville
and other Scotsmen as hostages.<a id='r1057' /><a href='#f1057' class='c017'><sup>[1057]</sup></a> Such was the position of
affairs when John was brought to bay at Runnymede. The
barons were willing to bid for the alliance of Alexander;
yet it was unnecessary to bid high, since his unsatisfied
claims on the northern counties predisposed him against
the English king. The barons, therefore, did nothing calculated
to endanger such hold as England had over the
Scottish Crown. John promised to restore Alexander’s
sisters and other hostages unconditionally, but used words
which committed him on none of the disputed points.<a id='r1058' /><a href='#f1058' class='c017'><sup>[1058]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>Franchises and “right” were to be restored only in so
far as accorded with the terms of King William’s
“charters” as interpreted by the judgment of the English
barons in the court of the English king.<a id='r1059' /><a href='#f1059' class='c017'><sup>[1059]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The allusion to the Scottish king as one among “our
other barons of England” need not be pressed against
Alexander any more than similar expressions should be
pressed against John, whose position as Duke of Normandy
and Aquitaine in no way made England a fief
of the French Crown. In questions affecting his feudal
position in France, John’s peers were the dukes and
counts of that country; and similarly those who had a
right to sit in judgment as Alexander’s peers over his
claims to English fiefs were the English earls and barons.
Such a tribunal was not likely to give decisions favourable
to Scots pretensions at the expense of England.<a id='r1060' /><a href='#f1060' class='c017'><sup>[1060]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Alexander, though no party to the treaty at Runnymede,
was willing to extract such benefit from it as he could.
Accordingly, on 7th July, 1215, he despatched the Archbishop
of St. Andrews and five laymen to John “concerning
our business which we have against you to be transacted in
your court.”<a id='r1061' /><a href='#f1061' class='c017'><sup>[1061]</sup></a> Nothing came of this; and when the civil
war began Alexander invaded England in order to push his
claims. John swore his usual oath, "by God’s teeth," that
he would “chase the little red-haired fox-cub from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>hiding holes.”<a id='r1062' /><a href='#f1062' class='c017'><sup>[1062]</sup></a> Neither Alexander’s participation in the
war nor the subsequent efforts of diplomacy achieved settlement
of the questions in dispute. None of the latent
ambiguities had been finally removed when the relations
between the two countries entered on a new phase as a
consequence of the attempts at annexation made by Edward
I., “the hammer of the Scots.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It would have been as impolitic as it was obviously
unfair for the barons, in their capacity of mesne lords,
to inflict upon their own tenants—the men without whose
support they would have been powerless at Runnymede—those
very exactions which they compelled the king to
abjure as against themselves. Accordingly, the benefit
of the same “customs and liberties” conceded by John
to his feudal tenants was—in a somewhat perfunctory
manner it is true—extended also to the feudal tenants
of all other magnates, whether cleric or lay. Although
the reference to “customs and liberties” was quite
general in its terms, it seems natural to infer that feudal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>grievances were chiefly, if not exclusively, intended, since
the view of society indicated is feudal rather than national,
and this is quite in keeping with many other clauses of
the Charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>These considerations suggest that too wide and liberal
a view has sometimes been taken of the scope of this
chapter. Coke treated it as affecting not merely freeholders,
but the whole mass of the people, and as enunciating
a doctrine of mutual responsibility between the king and
his subjects. “This is the chief felicity of a kingdom,
when good laws are reciprocally of prince and people (as
is here undertaken) duly observed.”<a id='r1063' /><a href='#f1063' class='c017'><sup>[1063]</sup></a> In this view he has
had many followers, and the present chapter has received
undue emphasis as supporting a democratic interpretation
of Magna Carta.<a id='r1064' /><a href='#f1064' class='c017'><sup>[1064]</sup></a> It has sometimes been referred to as
“the only clause which affects the whole body of the
people.”<a id='r1065' /><a href='#f1065' class='c017'><sup>[1065]</sup></a> The better view is that its provisions were
confined to freeholders.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even authors who interpret the chapter in this
restricted application are still prone to exaggerate its
importance. Two opposite lines of comment, in favour
respectively with historians of two different schools, seem
equally in need of supplement. (1) This clause is sometimes
regarded as springing directly from the barons’ own
uncontrolled initiative. Dr. Stubbs takes this view, contrasting
its substance with similar restraints imposed by
Henry I. on the barons by his Charter of Liberties, and
emphasizing as specially notable the fact that the present
clause was “adopted by the lords themselves.”<a id='r1066' /><a href='#f1066' class='c017'><sup>[1066]</sup></a> Such
praise is unmerited; the barons had no option, since the
omission of provisions to this effect would have been a
glaring absurdity and a most imprudent act. (2) On the
other hand, credit for the clause, equally unwarranted, has
been sometimes bestowed on John. Dr. Robert Henry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>says that “this article, which was highly reasonable, was
probably inserted at the desire of the king.”<a id='r1067' /><a href='#f1067' class='c017'><sup>[1067]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The substance of this chapter appears in the reissues of
1217 and 1225; but its force is there greatly impaired by
the addition of a new clause inconsistent with its spirit,
reserving to archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, templars,
hospitallers, earls, barons, and all other persons as well
ecclesiastical as secular, all the franchises and free customs
they previously had.<a id='r1068' /><a href='#f1068' class='c017'><sup>[1068]</sup></a> The chief object of this was presumably
to make it clear that Magna Carta, while conferring
benefits, took nothing away; but it would naturally be
interpreted as a saving clause in favour of aristocrats in
their relations with their dependants (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>erga suos</i></span>”) as well
as with the Crown, thus modifying the clause which
immediately preceded it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since, moreover, for God and the amendment of our kingdom,
and for the better allaying of the quarrel that has arisen
between us and our barons, we have granted all these concessions,

security, namely, that the barons choose five-and-twenty
barons of the kingdom, whomsoever they will, who shall be
bound with all their might, to observe and hold, and cause
to be observed, the peace and liberties we have granted and
confirmed to them by this our present Charter, so that if we,

anything be at fault toward anyone, or shall have broken any one
of the articles of the peace or of this security, and the offence
be notified to four barons of the foresaid five-and-twenty, the
said four barons shall repair to us (or our justiciar, if we are
out of the realm) and, laying the transgression before us,
petition to have that transgression corrected without delay.
And if we shall not have corrected the transgression (or, in
the event of our being out of the realm, if our justiciar shall
not have corrected it) within forty days, reckoning from the

<p class='c001'>This important chapter stands by itself, providing
machinery for enforcing all that precedes it. It thus
forms what modern jurisprudence would describe as the
“sanction” of the whole, but what was known in the current
phrase of its own day as “the form of security” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>forma
securitatis ad observandum pacem et libertates</i></span>).<a id='r1070' /><a href='#f1070' class='c017'><sup>[1070]</sup></a> It contains
the only executive clause of the Charter, the sole constitutional
machinery provided for enforcing the rights now
defined on parchment, the sole protection against future
attempts of the king to render them of no effect.</p>

<p class='c001'>I. <i>The Nature of the “Security” or legal Sanction.</i> The
procedure devised for enforcing the Charter was exceedingly
crude: John conferred upon twenty-five of his most bitter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>enemies a legal right to organize rebellion, whenever in
their opinion he had broken one of the provisions of Magna
Carta. Violence might be legally used against him, until
he redressed their alleged grievances “to their own
satisfaction” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>secundum arbitrium eorum</i></span>). If it had been
possible to put so violent an expedient in practice, the
“sovereignty,” or supreme power in England, would have
been split into two for practical purposes. While the
old monarchy remained theoretically intact, John would
have held the sceptre, still nominally his, only until his
opponents declared that he had broken some part of the
Charter, when, by his own previously-granted mandate,
it would pass, along with wide powers of coercion, to the
twenty-five barons forming what is sometimes described as a
Committee of Executors, but which was rather a Committee
of Rebellion.<a id='r1071' /><a href='#f1071' class='c017'><sup>[1071]</sup></a> Instead of using, as was afterwards done
with steadily increasing success, the king’s own administrative
machinery and his own servants to restrain his own
misdeeds, the barons preferred to set up a rival executive of
their own, with wide but ill-defined powers, and connected
with the older executive by no constitutional bonds. So
long as a single alleged grievance remained unredressed, a
new administration composed of John’s political antagonists
existed in an attitude of, at best, armed neutrality, side by
side with King John as the representative of the older
system of monarchic administration.</p>

<p class='c001'>The procedure for redressing grievances was described in
some detail; the wronged party must make known his case
to four barons of the twenty-five, and these would then
personally make it known to the king, and ask redress.
John was allowed time to effect this, but if he refused
or delayed, then compulsion might be used. The Articles of
the Barons had left the maximum term of delay unspecified,
merely saying “within a reasonable time to be determined
in the Charter.” The Charter did determine this, naming
forty days. Compulsion might take any form (for example
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>seizure of castles, lands, and personal estate), except violence
against the person of the king, or against his wife or
children. The present chapter, then, contained the only
legal sanction mentioned in the Charter, and this may be
briefly summarized as the delegation by John to a revolutionary
committee of the baronial opposition, of wide
powers of coercion to be used against him.</p>

<p class='c001'>II. <i>Minor Details of the Scheme.</i> Although the whole
expedient seems utterly chimerical to the modern mind,
the opposition leaders in 1215 evidently thought they had
devised a practicable scheme of government. This is shown
by the care with which they elaborated the procedure
to be adopted at different stages and in various contingencies.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <i>Appointment of the twenty-five executors.</i> The members
of the committee were to be, in the first instance,
“elected” (a loose word already discussed) by the “barons.”
The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>majores barones</i></span> of chapter 14 would undoubtedly have
the controlling voice; but the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>minores barones</i></span> might possibly
have taken some share in the appointment. Vacancies
which occurred through death, absence from England, or
any other cause, were to be filled by the method now
known as “co-optation.” The committee, once appointed,
would form a close corporation; no one uncongenial to the
majority could gain admission—an arrangement with a
thoroughly oligarchic flavour. The provision for supplying
vacancies caused by death proves that the scheme was not
to be temporary, but to last during John’s lifetime or
longer. Twenty-five magnates seem to have been actually
selected. The writs issued to the Sheriffs on 19th June
command the enforcement of the oath to the twenty-five
barons, but do not mention them by name. Matthew
Paris supplies the omission, and though he does not disclose
the source of his information, it is unlikely that so comprehensive
a list could be entirely a work of the imagination.<a id='r1072' /><a href='#f1072' class='c017'><sup>[1072]</sup></a>
They occur in the following order, the earls of Hertford,
Aumâle, Gloucester, Winchester, Hereford, Norfolk, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>Oxford, William Marshall the younger, Robert fitz Walter
the elder, Gilbert de Clare, Eustace de Vesci, Hugh Bigod,
William of Mowbray, William Hardell (Mayor of London),
William de Lanvalei, Robert de Ros, John de Lacy
(Constable of Chester), Richard de Perci, John fitz Robert,
William Mallet, Geoffrey de Say, Roger de Mumbezon,
William of Huntingfield, Richard de Muntfitchet, and
William of Albini.<a id='r1073' /><a href='#f1073' class='c017'><sup>[1073]</sup></a> There are here no churchmen and no
members of the moderate party whose names appear in
the preamble. All except two, or at the most three, of
the twenty-five were drawn from those factions of the
baronage who were the declared enemies of John.<a id='r1074' /><a href='#f1074' class='c017'><sup>[1074]</sup></a> It was
an oligarchy of disaffected Crown tenants, whose baronial
homogeneity was only broken by the presence of one
representative of other classes, the Mayor of London. Such
a committee was not likely to use the excessive powers
delegated to it by John to further any other interests than
its own. Even Stephen Langton and his fellow-prelates
were soon to discover this, as the two protests issued by
them clearly prove.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>A majority of those present to form a quorum.</i>
Driven by the necessities of the case, the barons devised,
or stumbled upon, a peculiarly modern expedient. The
presence of every member of the committee of twenty-five
could not reasonably be expected upon every occasion,
while absolute unanimity on questions of delicacy would be
difficult to obtain. It was provided, accordingly, that the
will of the majority of those present should prevail. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>would be inaccurate to say, in modern phraseology, that
thirteen formed a quorum, since the quorum varied with
the number of those present. It is notable that no provision
was made for summoning or constituting meetings of
the committee endowed with these tremendous powers.
Room was thus left for packed meetings of one faction
being hurriedly convened and usurping the rights of the
whole body. The precedent thus tentatively introduced
for the right of a majority to act for the whole was followed
only timidly and at long intervals. Still, its appearance
in John’s Charter marks a stage in the advance of the
valuable principle of modern politics which substitutes the
“counting of heads for the breaking of them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <i>The sub-committee of four.</i> Four of the twenty-five
Executors were to act as a medium of intercourse
between aggrieved individuals and the king, being charged
with the duty of hearing complaints and laying them
before John. Such a position would involve wide discretionary
powers; for if the four barons refused to
endorse the justice of the complaint, John also would be
in safety to refuse.<a id='r1075' /><a href='#f1075' class='c017'><sup>[1075]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <i>Local agents of the twenty-five executors.</i> In each
county the twelve knights, whose original function was to
preside at inquiries into “evil customs,” came to act as
the local representatives of the revolutionary committee,
being associated with the sheriff in the discharge of all
his duties and armed with power to constrain him to carry
out the provisions of Magna Carta, very much as the
twenty-five were authorized to constrain the king. In
particular, these knights were charged with the enforcement
of the oath of obedience to the revolutionary committee,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>and with the confiscation of the property of all who
refused.<a id='r1076' /><a href='#f1076' class='c017'><sup>[1076]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(5) <i>The part to be played by the public.</i> The king
authorized his subjects to side with the executors and against
him if he should violate the Charter, and to assist them
in such acts of violence as the forcible seizure of his castles,
lands, and personal estate; for his general mandate was
granted to the twenty-five “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cum communa totius terre</i></span>,”
while licence was “freely and publicly” bestowed on everyone
so disposed to swear obedience to the Executors in all
such acts, and to bring their weight to bear on the king to
the best of their ability. Two aspects of this provision
require special attention: (<i>a</i>) <i>Its relation to allegiance and
treason.</i> It was intended to operate as a provisional release
of John’s subjects from their oaths of fealty and homage,
and consequently from the pains and penalties of the
treason laws. John solemnly authorized his subjects, in
certain circumstances, to transfer their allegiance from himself
to the committee of his foes. If they refused, he
promised to compel them; and on 27th June, 1215, writs
were actually issued instructing the seizure of the lands and
goods of all who would not swear to obey the twenty-five.<a id='r1077' /><a href='#f1077' class='c017'><sup>[1077]</sup></a>
(<i>b</i>) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Communa totius terre.</i></span> The “community of the whole
land” was thus to afford active help in subjecting the king
to the reign of law; and the phrase has been pressed into
the service of democracy by enthusiasts who seek to magnify
modern conceptions by finding their roots in the past.
Few words of medieval Latin offer a more tempting field to
enquirers than this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>communa</i></span>, which, with its English and
French equivalents, holds the key to many problems of
constitutional origins. A group of interesting questions
clusters round the three words “borough, guild, and commune,”
and the appearance in Magna Carta of a body
described as a “commune” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>communa totius terre</i></span>) in conjunction
with an oath of obedience to a revolutionary
committee suggests an interesting comparison with the
form of civic constitution known in that age as “the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>sworn commune.”<a id='r1078' /><a href='#f1078' class='c017'><sup>[1078]</sup></a> A second field of enquiry, equally
alluring, is suggested by the fact that the lower chamber
of the Mother of Parliaments, the English “House of
Commons,” was originally composed of the representatives
of the various communes or communities known as counties
and boroughs respectively.</p>

<p class='c001'>These wider questions are here referred to merely as
illustrations of the difficulties that lurk in the word
“commune,” and in the equally perplexing phrase “commune
of the whole land.”<a id='r1079' /><a href='#f1079' class='c017'><sup>[1079]</sup></a> The mere use of such a phrase
cannot be accepted as a proof that the Charter rests on a
broad popular basis.</p>

<p class='c001'>III. <i>Criticism of the Scheme.</i> The faults of the scheme,
whether viewed from the side of theory or of practice, are
obvious. It was a violent and unnatural measure, full of
immediate dangers, and calculated to exercise a baneful
influence on constitutional development in the future. The
fact that Magna Carta provided no better sanction for its
own enforcement than the right of legalized rebellion has
already been discussed as its cardinal defect.<a id='r1080' /><a href='#f1080' class='c017'><sup>[1080]</sup></a> Instead of
preventing the king from inflicting wrongs, it merely provided
forcible measures for the redress of those already
committed, thus adding the crowning evil of civil war to
those minor evils it sought to reform. That the whole
scheme was foredoomed to failure constitutes perhaps its
least conspicuous fault in the eyes of later history. It is
instructive to note a few of its other defects in detail.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) The scheme challenged hostility by its want of
moderation. It aimed at reducing the Crown at one
blow from the plenitude of irresponsible tyranny to a
position of degrading impotence. On every vexed political
question of the day, John’s authority would have been
superseded by that of twenty-five of the most hostile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>faction of the baronage. If the king thought himself
aggrieved in anything, he would require to plead his
cause humbly before a tribunal in which his opponents sat
as judges. The scheme was thus repugnant to the mass of
loyal Englishmen, who cherished a respect for the time-honoured
principle of monarchy. No king with a grain
of self-respect would long submit tamely to a position
so illogical and degrading—to remain a sovereign whose
“sovereignty” existed merely on the sufferance of his
enemies, a puppet-king whose subjects had the legal right
to coerce him. The powers thus conferred on a baronial
committee in 1215 were more sweeping than those conferred
on a similar committee in 1258, and yet the Parliament
which appointed the latter has been branded for all
time as “the Mad Parliament,” because of the violence of
its measures against the king.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) Rebellion, even where morally justified, is essentially
and necessarily illegal; to attempt to map out for it a
legitimate sphere of action is to attempt the logically
impossible. The barons, in their dearth of political experience,
and in the extremity of their need, had demanded
and obtained something more dangerous than the amplest
measure of constitutional authority. They had failed to
rise to the true conception of a limited monarchy. Their
scheme recognized a king still absolute in some matters,
but in others powerless and abject. They set up side by
side two rival Executives, each in different circumstances
supreme. The relations of the two were far from accurately
defined, even in theory, while collisions were certain to
occur frequently in practice. The powers of the twenty-five,
a body which received no proper organization, were
those of aggression rather than of administration. Viewed
in this light, the claims of the barons to constructive statesmanship
rank extremely low.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) The powers of the Revolutionary Committee, excessive
though ill-defined, backed by the sworn obedience of
all classes of the nation, would tend completely to paralyze
the king. The nominal sovereign, always nervous under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>this sword of Damocles, would lose all power of initiative,
while the committee, so powerful to reduce him to impotence,
would be powerless alike to goad him into action
or to act in his stead. The Revolutionary Committee had
been planned as a drag on a bad executive, not as a good
executive to take its place.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) Even as a drag, however, the efficiency of the committee
would have been completely neutralized in either
of two contingencies: if the barons composing it disagreed
among themselves, or, if the king refused to surrender,
preferring the appeal to arms. The monarch had always
the alternative of civil war, and the material and moral
advantage of acting on the defensive lay with him; while
the committee had to face the risks to which an attacking
party is invariably exposed. Not a single step to restrain
the king could legally be taken until he had precipitated
matters by committing a clear act of aggression, and had
thereafter received formal intimation followed by an interval
of forty days, during which he might complete his preparation
for war without fear of interruption.</p>

<p class='c001'>(5) If the scheme of the barons seems ill-suited to
meet the needs of the hour of its conception, it was
fraught with even greater dangers to the future development
of the English constitution. The problem it sought
to solve was one of no transient or unimportant nature,
since it was nothing less than the devising of legal
machinery to prevent the king from abusing the powers entrusted
to him. The barons sought the best method of turning
royal promises of reform into laws which succeeding
kings must obey. In attempting this, Magna Carta moved
along lines which were radically wrong; which, if not
departed from in time, would have rendered any enduring
progress impossible. The statesmanship which, while
leaving one king on the throne, subjected him to the
dictation of “five-and-twenty over-kings” in regard to
all vital questions of the day, was crude and ill-advised.
It is true that the party of reform throughout the long
reign of Henry III. clung to the same erroneous solution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>although under various modifications on points of detail;
but they met with no success. After half a century of
unrest a settlement seemed as far distant as before. If
the same policy had been persisted in during Edward’s
reign the English constitution, as it became known to
after ages, would never have been evolved. The dangers
and defects of schemes like those of 1215 and of 1258
are most clearly seen in contrast with the more tactful
efforts of Edward I. towards a true solution, along lines
leading in due time to complete success.</p>

<p class='c001'>The true policy for the barons was to use the king’s
own administrative machinery and the king’s own servants
to control the king himself. The principle was slowly
established that the sovereign could perform no single
act of prerogative except through the agency of the proper
minister or group of ministers. Each function of government
became associated with a specific office or organ
of the royal household. The rights of the official head
of each department became stereotyped, and his position
obtained full legal acknowledgment, while very gradually
the doctrine of ministerial responsibility grew up, compelling
each officer of the Crown to obey not only the
law of the land, but also the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Commune Concilium</cite></span>, fast
changing into the modern Parliament. The expedients
of an earlier age disappeared as no longer required,
when the king’s good faith was secured by means of the
friendly control of his own ministers, not by the violent
compulsion of his opponents. The credit of starting the
constitution on its right line of development is in great
measure due to Edward I.<a id='r1081' /><a href='#f1081' class='c017'><sup>[1081]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>IV. <i>Dr. Gneist’s Criticism.</i> Dangerous and even absurd
as this scheme appears, it has found its apologist. Dr.
Gneist accuses English historians of making “very inappropriate
comparisons” between this baronial committee
and the continental expedients of the same period. While
in most countries of Europe, each baron arrogated the
right of private war against his sovereign in circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>to be determined by his own individual judgment, Magna
Carta conferred rights of rebellion only on the barons
“in their collective capacity,” and “as represented by
definite organs.”<a id='r1082' /><a href='#f1082' class='c017'><sup>[1082]</sup></a> The substitution of collective repressive
measures for the right of private feud undoubtedly marks
an advance; but rebellion, even when organized, cannot
be considered a satisfactory constitutional expedient. Dr.
Gneist is scarcely more convincing when he argues that
English historians and jurists have condemned too unreservedly
a scheme which is “so far in harmony with
the spirit of the feudal state of the Middle Ages as it
was based upon a mutual relation of feudal protection
and fealty, that is, upon compact.” “The concession by
agreement,” he continues, “of the rights of distress was
altogether so entirely consonant with the legal conceptions
of the Middle Ages that in this way the committee of
resistance loses a portion of its apparently revolutionary
character.”<a id='r1083' /><a href='#f1083' class='c017'><sup>[1083]</sup></a> That the Middle Ages approved of revolution
does not, however, change it into constitutional action;
while the fact that it was founded upon the feudal conception
of mutual contract may explain it, but does not
render it more worthy of admiration. The whole scheme
was, of course, thoroughly in accord with the public opinion
of the age, but that merely shows how wide is the gulf
which separates medieval conceptions from modern ones,
and how absurd it is to regard the Great Charter, as is
sometimes done, as anticipating the fundamental principles
of the English constitution of to-day.</p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of all apologies, the crudeness of the only
sanction provided by Magna Carta for its own enforcement
prevents it from ranking as a great monument of
constructive statesmanship.</p>

<p class='c001'>V. <i>Failure of the Scheme.</i> Almost before John’s Magna
Carta, in its completed form, had been engrossed and
sealed, the futility of its sanction was recognized. Each
side grew suspicious and demanded new “sanctions,” new
guarantees not contained in the Charter.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>(1) <i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</i> Magna Carta, assuming
apparently that perfect trust could be placed in the
rectitude and wisdom of the Revolutionary Committee,
provided no machinery for controlling them, no guarantee
that they would observe the Charter without misinterpreting
its provisions to suit their own selfish interests.
The futility of this complacency was soon manifest. One
tyrant had brought distress on the whole nation; and
now he was to be superseded by five-and-twenty. Who was
to restrain the new tyrants? A second committee was
nominated partly to assist and partly to control the twenty-five.
Matthew Paris<a id='r1084' /><a href='#f1084' class='c017'><sup>[1084]</sup></a> describes it as composed of thirty-eight
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Obsecutores et Observatores</cite></span>,” including the Earl
Marshal, Hubert de Burgh, the earls of Arundel and
Warenne, and other prominent members of the moderate
party, not unfriendly to the king. Dr. Stubbs dismisses
their relations to the executors with the remark that they
“swore to obey the orders of the twenty-five.”<a id='r1085' /><a href='#f1085' class='c017'><sup>[1085]</sup></a> Miss
Norgate takes what seems to be a better view, in emphasizing
as the chief reason for their appointment the
duty of compelling “both the king and the twenty-five
to deal justly with one another.”<a id='r1086' /><a href='#f1086' class='c017'><sup>[1086]</sup></a> The thirty-eight were
required to constrain the twenty-five, as the twenty-five
constrained the king.<a id='r1087' /><a href='#f1087' class='c017'><sup>[1087]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <i>Suspicions of the barons’ good faith.</i> Whether the
appointment of the committee of thirty-eight was due
partly to John’s influence or was entirely the result of
mutual jealousies in the ranks of those opposed to him,
there is absolute evidence that the king was distrustful
of the barons’ good faith, and desired on his part some
“sanction” that they would not again renounce that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>allegiance, the renewal of which was the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quid pro quo</i></span>
for which he had granted the Charter. Apparently the
leading barons did renew their oath of fealty and homage
on 19th June at Runnymede; but refused to grant a
formal Charter to that effect, although they had promised
to give any security John might require, except hostages
or castles. The prelates when appealed to sided with
the king; they executed a formal declaration or protest,
recording the barons’ promise and subsequent refusal to
give effect to it. There is no reason to doubt the testimony
of the prelates; they had been present at all the negotiations,
and it was by their mediation that the terms
of peace embodied in Magna Carta had been settled.
This was not the only matter on which the bishops found
it necessary to intervene on the king’s behalf. The new
baronial executive and the twelve knights who acted as
their agents in each county, pushed to unfair lengths the
authority to reform abuses conferred on them in terms
of Magna Carta. In particular, they proceeded virtually
to abolish the royal forests altogether by abrogating as
evil customs the procedure on which this branch of the
Crown’s prerogative rested. The prelates placed on record
a formal protest on this head also.<a id='r1088' /><a href='#f1088' class='c017'><sup>[1088]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <i>Suspicions of John’s good faith.</i> If neither the king
nor the nation at large considered that the Great Charter
contained sufficient safeguards of their interests against
the Committee of Executors, the barons themselves soon
came to the conclusion that the Committee, in spite of
all its powers, formed an inadequate sanction against John.
Accordingly they demanded further “security.” The city
of London was placed in their hands, and the Tower of
London in the neutral custody of the primate, as pledges
of John’s good faith, until 15th August or longer if
need were. Those terms were reduced to writing in a
document entitled “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Conventio facta inter Regem Anglie
et barones ejusdem regni</i></span>,” which thus supplied a new
sanction, or “form of security,” supplementing, if not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>superseding, that contained in chapter 61 of Magna
Carta.<a id='r1089' /><a href='#f1089' class='c017'><sup>[1089]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <i>Precautions against papal intervention.</i> The Articles
of the barons afford undoubted evidence of its framers’
suspicions that John would apply to Rome for absolution
from his bargain. They showed considerable shrewdness
in demanding that the English prelates and the papal
legate should become the king’s sureties that he would
not procure from the Pope anything to invalidate the
Charter or diminish its efficacy. If Pandulf, as the Pope’s
accredited agent, had actually put his seal to such a
document, he would have seriously embarrassed his august
master in supporting John in a course of repudiation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two important alterations in the completed Charter
were effected, however, whether at John’s instance, or at
that of Pandulf, or of the English prelates, is matter of
conjecture. No mention was made of Innocent by name,
the clause being made quite general in its terms. John
merely promised to procure a dispensation “from no one,”
while the question of sureties was quietly ignored. The
reason for the omission readily suggests itself; Pandulf
would naturally object to commit his principal or himself
to any pledge of the kind. The Pope preserved perfect
freedom, and the use which he made of this is matter of
common knowledge.<a id='r1090' /><a href='#f1090' class='c017'><sup>[1090]</sup></a></p>

“Boys” in place of “Ros,” and “Roger de Munbrai” in place of “Roger

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1075'>1075</a>. An alternative explanation is also possible, namely, that the function
of intermediary might be exercised by any four members of the twenty-five.
In that view, an aggrieved individual might have pressure placed
upon the king if he persuaded any four to act together in support of his
claim. This would imply a second quorum, this time of four, for a special
purpose, in addition to the quorum of varying numbers already discussed.
In either view, the road to redress would be easier for the great man than
for his obscure neighbour.</p>

that the English church should be free (omitting, however,
any second reference to canonical election) and that

legal documents. The actual giving by John’s hand was

<p class='c001'>5. Rex vel ballivus non saisiet terram aliquam pro debito dum

dum capitalis debitor sufficit ad solutionem; si vero capitalis
debitor defecerit in solutione, si plegii voluerint, habeant terras
debitoris, donec debitum illud persolvatur plene, nisi capitalis
debitor monstrare poterit se esse inde quietum erga plegios.</p>

<p class='c001'>6. Rex non concedet alicui baroni quod capiat auxilium de
liberis hominibus suis, nisi ad corpus suum redimendum, et ad
faciendum primogenitum filium suum militem, et ad primogenitam
filiam suam semel maritandam, et hoc faciet per rationabile
auxilium.</p>

<p class='c001'>7. Ne aliquis majus servitium faciat de feodo militis quam
inde debetur.</p>

<p class='c001'>8. Ut communia placita non sequantur curiam domini regis,
sed assignentur in aliquo certo loco; et ut recognitiones capiantur
in eisdem comitatibus, in hunc modum: ut rex mittat duos
justiciaros per .iiii<sup>or</sup>. vices in anno, qui cum .iiii<sup>or</sup>. militibus

catalla, nisi statim denarios inde reddat, nisi respectum habere
possit de voluntate venditoris.</p>

<p class='c001'>19. Ne constabularius possit distringere aliquem militem ad

nisi ex voluntate ipsius.</p>

<p class='c001'>21. Ne rex vel ballivus suus capiat alienum boscum ad castra

<p class='c001'>25. Si quis fuerit disseisitus vel prolongatus per regem sine
juditio de terris, libertatibus, et jure suo, statim ei restituatur;
et si contentio super hoc orta fuerit, tunc inde disponatur per
juditium .xxv. baronum, et ut illi qui fuerint dissaisiti per
patrem vel fratrem regis, rectum habeant sine dilatione per

<p class='c001'>27. Si aliquis tenet de rege per feodi firmam, per sokagium,

rex non habebit custodiam militum de feodo alterius, occasione
burgagii vel sokagii, nec debet habere custodiam burgagii,
sokagii, vel feodi firme; et quod liber homo non amittat militiam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>suam occasione parvarum sergantisarum, sicuti de illis qui
tenent aliquod tenementum reddendo inde cuttellos vel sagittas
vel hujusmodi.</p>

<p class='c001'>28. Ne aliquis ballivus possit ponere aliquem ad legem simplici
loquela sua sine testibus fidelibus.</p>

<p class='c001'>29. Ne corpus liberi hominis capiatur, nec imprisonetur, nec
dissaisietur, nec utlagetur, nec exuletur, nec aliquo modo destruatur,
nec rex eat vel mittat super eum vi, nisi per juditium parium
suorum vel per legem terre.</p>

<p class='c001'>30. Ne jus vendatur vel differratur vel vetitum sit.</p>

<p class='c001'>31. Quod mercatores habeant salvum ire et venire ad emendum
vel vendendum, sine omnibus malis toltis, per antiquas
et rectas consuetudines.</p>

<p class='c001'>32. Ne scutagium vel auxilium ponatur in regno, nisi per
commune consilium regni, nisi ad corpus regis redimendum,
et primogenitum filium suum militem faciendum, et filiam suam
primogenitam semel maritandam; et ad hoc fiat rationabile
auxilium. Simili modo fiat de taillagiis et auxiliis de civitate
Londonie, et de aliis civitatibus que inde habent libertates, et ut
civitas Londonie plene habeat antiquas libertates et liberas consuetudines
suas, tam per aquas, quam per terras.</p>

<p class='c001'>33. Ut liceat unicuique exire de regno et redire, salva fide
domini regis, nisi tempore werre per aliquod breve tempus propter
communem utilitatem regni.</p>

<p class='c001'>34. Si quis mutuo aliquid acceperit a Judeis plus vel minus,
et moriatur antequam debitum illud solvatur, debitum non
usurabit quamdiu heres fuerit infra etatem, de quocumque teneat;
et si debitum illud inciderit in manum regis, rex non capiet nisi
catallum quod continetur in carta.</p>

<p class='c001'>35. Si quis moriatur et debitum debeat Judeis, uxor ejus
habeat dotem suam; et si liberi remanserint, provideantur eis
necessaria secundum tenementum; et de residuo solvatur debitum
salvo servitio dominorum; simili modo fiat de aliis debitis; et ut
custos terre reddat heredi, cum ad plenam etatem pervenerit,
terram suam instauratam secundum quod rationabiliter poterit
sustinere de exitibus terre ejusdem de carucis et wainnagiis.</p>

<p class='c001'>36. Si quis tenuerit de aliqua eskaeta, sicut de honore Walingeford,
Notingeham, Bononie, et Lankastrie, et de aliis eskaetis
que sunt in manu regis et sunt baronie, et obierit, heres ejus
non dabit aliud relevium, vel faciet regi aliud servitium quam
faceret baroni; et ut rex eodem modo eam teneat quo baro
eam tenuit.</p>

<p class='c001'>37. Ut fines qui facti sunt pro dotibus, maritagiis, hereditatibus,
et amerciamentis, injuste et contra legem terre, omnino
condonentur; vel fiat inde per juditium, .xxv. baronum, vel per
juditium majoris partis eorumdem, una cum archiepiscopo et
aliis quos secum vocare voluerit ita quod, si aliquis vel aliqui de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>.xxv. fuerint in simili querela, amoveantur et alii loco illorum per
residuos de .xxv. substituantur.</p>

<p class='c001'>38. Quod obsides et carte reddantur, quae liberate fuerunt
regi in securitatem.</p>

<p class='c001'>39. Ut illi qui fuerint extra forestam non veniant coram
justiciariis de foresta per communes summonitiones, nisi sint in
placito vel plegii fuerint; et ut prave consuetudines de forestis
et de forestariis, et warenniis, et vicecomitibus, et rivariis, emendentur
per .xii. milites de quolibet comitatu, qui debent eligi per
probos homines ejusdem comitatus.</p>

<p class='c001'>40. Ut rex amoveat penitus de balliva parentes et totam
sequelam Gerardi de Atyes, quod de cetero balliam non habeant,
scilicet Engelardum, Andream, Petrum, et Gyonem de Cancellis,
Gyonem de Cygony, Matheum de Martiny, et fratres ejus; et
Galfridum nepotem ejus et Philippum Mark.</p>

<p class='c001'>41. Et ut rex amoveat alienigenas, milites, stipendiarios, balistarios,
et ruttarios, et servientes qui veniunt cum equis et armis
ad nocumentum regni.</p>

<p class='c001'>42. Ut rex faciat justiciarios, constabularios, vicecomites, et
ballivos, de talibus qui sciant legem terre et eam bene velint
observare.</p>

<p class='c001'>43. Ut barones qui fundaverunt abbatias, unde habent cartas
regum vel antiquam tenuram, habeant custodiam earum cum
vacaverint.</p>

<p class='c001'>44. Si rex Walenses dissaisierit vel elongaverit de terris vel
libertatibus, vel de rebus aliis in Anglia vel in Wallia, eis statim
sine placito reddantur; et si fuerint dissaisiti vel elongati de
tenementis suis Anglie per patrem vel fratrem regis sine juditio
parium suorum, rex eis sine dilatione justiciam exhibebit, eo
modo quo exhibet Anglicis justiciam de tenementis suis Anglie
secundum legem Anglie, et de tenementis Wallie secundum
legem Wallie, et de tenementis Marchie secundum legem
Marchie; idem facient Walenses regi et suis.</p>

<div class='column-container'>

<div class='col60'>

<p class='c001'>45. Ut rex reddat filium Lewelini et preterea

suo cum ipsis; et rex pubblice et libere dabit licentiam jurandi
cuilibet qui jurare voluerit, et nulli umquam jurare prohibebit.
Omnes autem illos de terra qui sponte sua et per se noluerint
jurare .xxv. baronibus de distringendo et gravando regem cum
eis, rex faciet jurare eosdem de mandato suo sicut predictum
est. Item si aliquis de predictis .xxv. baronibus decesserit, vel a
terra recesserit, vel aliquo modo alio impeditus fuerit quominus
ista predicta possint exequi, qui residui fuerint de .xxv. eligent
alium loco ipsius pro arbitrio suo, qui simili modo erit juratus
quo et ceteri. In omnibus autem que istis .xxv. baronibus committuntur
exequenda, si forte ipsi .xxv. presentes fuerint et inter
se super re aliqua discordaverint, vel aliqui ex eis vocati nolint
vel nequeant interesse, ratum habebitur et firmum quod major
pars ex eis providerit vel preceperit, ac si omnes .xxv. in hoc
consensissent; et predicti .xxv. jurabunt quod omnia antedicta
fideliter observabunt et pro toto posse suo facient observari.
Preterea rex faciet eos securos per cartas archiepiscopi et episcoporum
et magistri Pandulfi, quod nichil impetrabit a domino
papa per quod aliqua istarum conventionum revocetur vel
minuatur, et, si aliquid tale impetraverit, reputetur irritum et
inane et numquam eo utatur.</p>

Aquitanie, et comes Andegavie, archiepiscopis, episcopis,
abbatibus, prioribus, comitibus, baronibus, vicecomitibus, prepositis,
ministris et omnibus ballivis et fidelibus suis presentem
cartam inspecturis, salutem. Sciatis quod intuitu Dei et pro
salute anime nostre et animarum antecessorum et successorum
nostrorum, ad exaltationem sancte ecclesie et emendationem
regni nostri, concessimus et hac presenti carta confirmavimus
pro nobis et heredibus nostris in perpetuum, de consilio venerabilis
patris nostri domini Gualonis tituli Sancti Martini presbiteri
cardinalis et apostolice sedis legati, domini Walteri Eboracensis
archiepiscopi, Willelmi Londoniensis episcopi, et aliorum episcoporum
Anglie et Willelmi Mariscalli comitis Pembrocie, rectoris
nostri et regni nostri, et aliorum fidelium comitum et baronum
nostrorum Anglie, has libertates tenendas in regno nostro
Anglie in perpetuum.</p>

<p class='c001'>1. In primis concessimus Deo et hac presenti carta nostra
confirmavimus pro nobis et heredibus nostris in perpetuum
quod anglicana ecclesia libera sit, et habeat jura sua integra
et libertates suas illesas. Concessimus etiam omnibus liberis
hominibus regni nostri pro nobis et heredibus nostris in perpetuum
omnes libertates subscriptas, habendas et tenendas eis et
heredibus suis de nobis et heredibus nostris.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. Si quis comitum vel baronum nostrorum sive aliorum
tenencium de nobis in capite per servicium militare mortuus
fuerit, et, cum decesserit, heres ejus plene etatis fuerit et
relevium debeat, habeat hereditatem suam per antiquum
relevium, scilicet heres vel heredes comitis de baronia comitis
integra per centum libras, heres vel heredes baronis de baronia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>integra per centum libras, heres vel heredes militis de feodo
militis integro per centum solidos ad plus; et qui minus debuerit
minus det secundum antiquam consuetudinem feodorum.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. Si autem heres alicujus talium fuerit infra etatem, dominus
ejus non habeat custodiam ejus nec terre sue antequam homagium
ejus ceperit; et, postquam talis heres fuerit in custodia, cum ad
etatem pervenerit, scilicet viginti et unius anni, habeat hereditatem
suam sine relevio et sine fine, ita tamen quod, si
ipse, dum infra etatem fuerit, fiat miles, nichilominus terra
remaneat in custodia dominorum suorum usque ad terminum
predictum.</p>

<p class='c001'>4. Custos terre hujusmodi heredis qui infra etatem fuerit non
capiat de terra heredis nisi rationabiles exitus et rationabiles
consuetudines et rationabilia servicia, et hoc sine destructione et
vasto hominum vel rerum; et si nos commiserimus custodiam
alicujus talis terre vicecomiti vel alicui alii qui de exitibus terre
illius nobis debeat respondere, et ille destructionem de custodia
fecerit vel vastum, nos ab illo capiemus emendam, et terra committatur
duobus legalibus et discretis hominibus de feodo illo
qui de exitibus nobis respondeant vel ei cui eos assignaverimus;
et si dederimus vel vendiderimus alicui custodiam alicujus talis
terre, et ille destructionem inde fecerit vel vastum, amittat ipsam
custodiam et tradatur duobus legalibus et discretis hominibus de
feodo illo qui similiter nobis respondeant, sicut predictum est.</p>

<p class='c001'>5. Custos autem, quamdiu custodiam terre habuerit, sustentet
domos, parcos, vivaria, stagna, molendina et cetera ad terram
illam pertinencia de exitibus terre ejusdem, et reddat heredi, cum
ad plenam etatem pervenerit, terram suam totam instauratam de
carucis et omnibus aliis rebus, ad minus secundum quod illam
recepit. Hec omnia observentur de custodiis archiepiscopatuum,
episcopatuum, abbatiarum, prioratuum, ecclesiarum et dignitatum
vacancium que ad nos pertinent, excepto quod hujusmodi custodie
vendi non debent.</p>

<p class='c001'>6. Heredes maritentur absque disparagatione.</p>

<p class='c001'>7. Vidua post mortem mariti sui statim et sine difficultate
aliqua habeat maritagium suum et hereditatem suam, nec aliquid
det pro dote sua vel pro maritagio suo vel pro hereditate sua,
quam hereditatem maritus suus et ipsa tenuerint die obitus
ipsius mariti, et maneat in capitali mesuagio mariti sui per quadraginta
dies post obitum ipsius mariti sui, infra quos assignetur
ei dos sua, nisi prius ei fuerit assignata, vel nisi domus ilia sit
castrum; et si de castro recesserit, statim provideatur ei domus
competens in qua possit honeste morari, quousque dos sua ei
assignetur secundum quod predictum est, et habeat rationabile
estoverium suum interim de communi. Assignetur autem ei pro
dote sua tercia pars tocius terre mariti sui que sua fuit in vita
sua, nisi de minori dotata fuerit ad hostium ecclesie.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>8. Nulla vidua distringatur ad se maritandam, dum vivere
voluerit sine marito, ita tamen quod securitatem faciet quod se
non maritabit sine assensu nostro, si de nobis tenuerit, vel sine
assensu domini sui, si de alio tenuerit.</p>

<p class='c001'>9. Nos vero vel ballivi nostri non seisiemus terram aliquam
nee redditum pro debito aliquo quamdiu catalla debitoris
presencia sufficiunt ad debitum reddendum et ipse debitor paratus
sit inde satisfacere; nee plegii ipsius debitoris distringantur
quamdiu ipse capitalis debitor sufficiat ad solutionem debiti; et,
si capitalis debitor defecerit in solutione debiti, non habens unde
reddat aut reddere nolit cum possit, plegii respondeant pro
debito; et, si voluerint, habeant terras et redditus debitoris
quousque sit eis satisfactum de debito quod ante pro eo solverint,
nisi capitalis debitor monstraverit se inde esse quietum versus
eosdem plegios.</p>

<p class='c001'>10. Civitas Londonie habeat omnes antiquas libertates et liberas
consuetudines suas. Preterea volumus et concedimus quod
omnes alie civitates, et burgi, et ville, et barones de quinque
portubus, et omnes portus, habeant omnes libertates et liberas
consuetudines suas.</p>

<p class='c001'>11. Nullus distringatur ad faciendum majus servicium de
feodo militis nec de alio libero tenemento quam inde debetur.</p>

<p class='c001'>12. Communia placita non sequantur curiam nostram, set
teneantur in aliquo loco certo.</p>

non capiantur nisi in suis comitatibus, et hoc modo: nos, vel si
extra regnum fuerimus, capitalis justiciarius noster, mittemus
justiciarios per unumquemque comitatum semel in anno, qui
cum militibus comitatuum capiant in comitatibus assisas predictas.</p>

<p class='c001'>14. Et ea que in illo adventu suo in comitatu per justiciarios
predictos ad dictas assisas capiendas missos terminari non possunt,
per eosdem terminentur alibi in itinere suo; et ea que per
eosdem propter difficultatem aliquorum articulorum terminari
non possunt, referantur ad justiciarios nostros de banco, et ibi
terminentur.</p>

<p class='c001'>15. Assise de ultima presentatione semper capiantur coram
justiciariis nostris de banco et ibi terminentur.</p>

<p class='c001'>16. Liber homo non amercietur pro parvo delicto nisi secundum
modum ipsius delicti, et pro magno delicto, secundum
magnitudinem delicti, salvo contenemento suo; et mercator
eodem modo salva mercandisa sua; et villanus alterius quam
noster eodem modo amercietur salvo wainagio suo, si incident
in misericordiam nostram: et nulla predictarum misericordiarum
ponatur nisi per sacramenta proborum et legalium hominum
de visneto.</p>

<p class='c001'>17. Comites et barones non amercientur nisi per pares suos, et
non nisi secundum modum delicti.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_583'>583</span>18. Nulla ecclesiastica persona amercietur secundum quantitatem
beneficii sui ecclesiastici, sed secundum laicum tenementum
suum, et secundum quantitatem delicti.</p>

<p class='c001'>19. Nec villa, nec homo, distringatur facere pontes ad riparias
nisi qui ex antiquo et de jure facere debet.</p>

<p class='c001'>20. Nulla riparia decetero defendatur, nisi ille que fuerunt in
defenso tempore regis Henrici avi nostri, per eadem loca et
eosdem terminos sicut esse consueverunt tempore suo.</p>

<p class='c001'>21. Nullus vicecomes, constabularius, coronatores vel alii ballivi
nostri teneant placita corone nostre.</p>

<p class='c001'>22. Si aliquis tenens de nobis laicum feodum moriatur, et
vicecomes vel ballivus noster ostendat litteras nostras patentes
de summonitione nostra de debito quod defunctus nobis debuit,
liceat vicecomiti vel ballivo nostro attachiare et inbreviare catalla
defuncti inventa in laico feodo ad valenciam illius debiti per
visum legalium hominum, ita tamen quod nichil inde amoveatur
donec persolvatur nobis debitum quod clarum fuerit, et residuum
relinquatur executoribus ad faciendum testamentum defuncti; et
si nichil nobis debeatur ab ipso, omnia catalla cedant defuncto,
salvis uxori ipsius rationabilibus partibus suis.</p>

<p class='c001'>23. Nullus constabularius vel ejus ballivus capiat blada vel
alia catalla alicujus qui non sit de villa ubi castrum situm est,
nisi statim inde reddat denarios aut respectum inde habere
possit de voluntate venditoris; si autem de villa ipsa fuerit, infra
quadraginta dies precium reddat.</p>

<p class='c001'>24. Nullus constabularius distringat aliquem militem ad dandum
denarios pro custodia castri, si ipse eam facere voluerit in
propria persona sua, vel per alium probum hominem, si ipse eam
facere non possit propter rationabilem causam, et, si nos duxerimus
eum vel miserimus in exercitum, erit quietus de custodia
secundum quantitatem temporis quo per nos fuerit in exercitu
de feodo pro quo fecit servicium in exercitu.</p>

<p class='c001'>25. Nullus vicecomes, vel ballivus noster, vel alius capiat equos
vel carettas alicujus pro cariagio faciendo, nisi reddat liberationem
antiquitus statutam, scilicet pro caretta ad duos equos decem
denarios per diem, et pro caretta ad tres equos quatuordecim
denarios per diem.</p>

<p class='c001'>26. Nulla caretta dominica alicujus ecclesiastice persone vel
militis vel alicujus domine capiatur per ballivos predictos.</p>

<p class='c001'>27. Nec nos nec ballivi nostri nec alii capiemus alienum
boscum ad castra vel alia agenda nostra, nisi per voluntatem
illius cujus boscus ille fuerit.</p>

<p class='c001'>28. Nos non tenebimus terras eorum qui convicti fuerint de

Michaelis sine occasione, ita scilicet quod quilibet habeat libertates
suas quas habuit et habere consuevit tempore regis Henrici
avi nostri, vel quas postea perquisivit. Fiat autem visus de
franco plegio sic, videlicet quod pax nostra teneatur, et quod

Normannie, Aquitanie et comes Andegavie, archiepiscopis, episcopis,

salute anime nostre et animarum antecessorum et successorum
nostrorum, ad exaltacionem Sancte Ecclesie et emendacionem
regni nostri, concessimus et hac presenti carta confirmavimus pro
nobis et heredibus nostris in perpetuum, de consilio venerabilis
patris nostri domini Gualonis tituli sancti Martini presbiteri
cardinalis et apostolice sedis legati, domini Walteri Eboracensis
archiepiscopi, Willelmi Londoniensis episcopi, et aliorum episcoporum
Anglie, et Willelmi Marescalli comitis Penbrocie,
rectoris nostri et regni nostri, et aliorum fidelium comitum et
baronum nostrorum Anglie, has libertates subscriptas tenendas
in regno nostro Anglie, in perpetuum:</p>

<p class='c001'>1. In primis omnes foreste quas Henricus rex avus noster
afforestavit videantur per bonos et legales homines et, si boscum
aliquem alium quam suum dominicum afforestaverit ad dampnum
illius cujus boscus fuerit, deafforestentur. Et si boscum suum
proprium afforestaverit, remaneat foresta, salva communa de
herbagio et aliis in eadem foresta, illis qui eam prius habere
consueverunt.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. Homines qui manent extra forestam non veniant decetero
coram justiciariis nostris de foresta per communes summoniciones,
nisi sint in placito, vel plegii alicujus vel aliquorum qui
attachiati sunt propter forestam.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. Omnes autem bosci qui fuerunt afforestati per regem
Ricardum avunculum nostrum, vel per regem Johannem patrem
nostrum usque ad primam coronacionem nostram, statim deafforestentur,
nisi fuerit dominicus boscus noster.</p>

<p class='c001'>4. Archiepiscopi, episcopi, abbates, priores, comites et barones
et milites et libere tenentes, qui boscos suos habent in forestis,
habeant boscos suos sicut eos habuerunt tempore prime coronacionis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_587'>587</span>predicti regis Henrici avi nostri, ita quod quieti sint in
perpetuum de omnibus purpresturis, vastis et assartis factis in
illis boscis, post illud tempus usque ad principium secundi anni
coronacionis nostre. Et qui de cetero vastum, purpresturam, vel
assartum sine licencia nostra in illis fecerint, de vastis et assartis
respondeant.</p>

<p class='c001'>5. Reguardores nostri eant per forestas ad faciendum reguardum
sicut fieri consuevit tempore prime coronacionis predicti
regis Henrici avi nostri, et non aliter.</p>

<p class='c001'>6. Inquisicio, vel visus de expeditacione canum existencium in
foresta, decetero fiat quando debet fieri reguardum, scilicet de
tercio anno in tercium annum; et tunc fiat per visum et testimonium
legalium hominum et non aliter. Et ille, cujus canis
inventus fuerit tunc non expeditatus, det pro misericordia tres
solidos; et de cetero nullus bos capiatur pro expeditacione.
Talis autem sit expeditacio per assisam communiter quod tres
ortilli abscidantur sine pelota de pede anteriori; nec expeditentur
canes de cetero, nisi in locis ubi consueverunt expeditari tempore
prime coronacionis regis Henrici avi nostri.</p>

<p class='c001'>7. Nullus forestarius vel bedellus decetero faciat scotale, vel
colligat garbas, vel avenam, vel bladum aliud, vel agnos, vel
porcellos, nec aliquam collectam faciant; et per visum et sacramentum
duodecim reguardorum quando facient reguardum, tot
forestarii ponantur ad forestas custodiendas, quot ad illas custodiendas
rationabiliter viderint sufficere.</p>

<p class='c001'>8. Nullum suanimotum de cetero teneatur in regno nostro
nisi ter in anno; videlicet in principio quindecim dierum ante
festum Sancti Michaelis, quando agistatores conveniunt ad agistandum
dominicos boscos nostros; et circa festum Sancti Martini
quando agistatores nostri debent recipere pannagium nostrum;
et ad ista duo suanimota conveniant forestarii, viridarii, et agistatores,
et nullus alius per districtionem; et tercium suanimotum
teneatur in inicio quindecim dierum ante festum Sancti Johannis
Baptiste, pro feonacione bestiarum nostrarum; et ad istud
suanimotum tenendum convenient forestarii et viridarii et nulli
alii per districtionem. Et preterea singulis quadraginta diebus
per totum annum conveniant viridarii et forestarii ad videndum
attachiamenta de foresta, tam de viridi, quam de venacione, per
presentacionem ipsorum forestariorum, et coram ipsis attachiatis.
Predicta autem suanimota non teneantur nisi in comitatibus in
quibus teneri consueverunt.</p>

<p class='c001'>9. Unusquisque liber homo agistet boscum suum in foresta
pro voluntate sua et habeat pannagium suum. Concedimus
eciam quod unusquisque liber homo possit ducere porcos suos
per dominicum boscum nostrum, libere et sine inpedimento,
ad agistandum eos in boscis suis propriis, vel alibi ubi voluerit.
Et si porci alicujus liberi hominis una nocte pernoctaverint in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_588'>588</span>foresta nostra, non inde occasionetur ita quod aliquid de suo
perdat.</p>

<p class='c001'>10. Nullus de cetero amittat vitam vel menbra pro venacione
nostra; set, si aliquis captus fuerit et convictus de
capcione venacionis, graviter redimatur, si habeat unde redimi
possit; et si non habeat unde redimi possit, jaceat in prisona
nostra per unum annum et unum diem; et, si post unum
annum et unum diem plegios invenire possit, exeat a prisona;
sin autem, adjuret regnum Anglie.</p>

<p class='c001'>11. Quicunque archiepiscopus, episcopus, comes vel baro transient
per forestam nostram, liceat ei capere unam vel duas bestias
per visum forestarii, si presens fuerit; sin autem, faciat cornari,
ne videatur furtive hoc facere.</p>

<p class='c001'>12. Unusquisque liber homo decetero sine occasione faciat
in bosco suo, vel in terra sua quam habeat in foresta, molendinum,
vivarium, stagnum, marleram, fossatum, vel terram
arabilem extra cooperatum in terra arabili, ita quod non sit
ad nocumentum alicujus vicini.</p>

<p class='c001'>13. Unusquisque liber homo habeat in boscis suis aereas,
ancipitrum et spervariorum et falconum, aquilarum, et de heyrinis
et habeat similiter mel quod inventum fuerit in boscis suis.</p>

<p class='c001'>14. Nullus forestarius de cetero, qui non sit forestarius de
feudo reddens nobis firmam pro balliva sua, capiat chiminagium
aliquod in balliva sua; forestarius autem de feudo firmam
nobis reddens pro balliva sua capiat chiminagium, videlicet
pro careta per dimidium annum duos denarios, et per alium
dimidium annum duos denarios, et pro equo qui portat
sumagium per dimidium annum unum obolum, et per alium
dimidium annum obolum, et non nisi de illis qui de extra
ballivam suam, tanquam mercatores, veniunt per licenciam suam
in ballivam suam ad buscam, meremium, corticem vel carbonem
emendum, et alias ducendum ad vendendum ubi voluerint: et
de nulla alia careta vel sumagio aliquod <a id='corr588.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='chimunagium'>chiminagium</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_588.33'><ins class='correction' title='chimunagium'>chiminagium</ins></a></span> capiatur:
et non capiatur chiminagium nisi in locis illis ubi antiquitus
capi solebat et debuit. Illi autem qui portant super dorsum
suum buscam, corticem, vel carbonem, ad vendendum, quamvis
inde vivant, nullum de cetero dent chiminagium. De boscis
autem aliorum nullum detur chiminagium <a id='corr588.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='foristariis'>forestariis</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_588.38'><ins class='correction' title='foristariis'>forestariis</ins></a></span> nostris,
preterquam de dominicis boscis nostris.</p>

<p class='c001'>15. Omnes utlagati pro foresta tantum a tempore regis
Henrici avi nostri usque ad primam coronacionem nostram,
veniant ad pacem nostram sine inpedimento, et salvos plegios
inveniant quod de cetero non forisfaciant nobis de foresta nostra.</p>

<p class='c001'>16. Nullus castellanus vel alius ten eat placita de foresta
sive de viridi sive de venacione, sed quilibet forestarius de feudo
attachiet placita de foresta tam de viridi quam de venacione,
et ea presentet viridariis provinciarum et cum irrotulata fuerint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>et sub sigillis viridariorum inclusa, presententur capitali
forestario cum in partes illas venerit ad tenendum placita
foreste, et coram eo terminentur.</p>

<p class='c001'>17. Has autem libertates de forestis concessimus omnibus, salvis
archiepiscopis, episcopis, abbatibus, prioribus, comitibus, baronibus,
militibus et aliis tam personis ecclesiasticis quam secularibus,
Templariis et Hospitalariis, libertatibus et liberis consuetudinibus
in forestis et extra, in warennis et aliis, quas prius habuerunt.
Omnes autem istas consuetudines predictas et libertates, quas
concessimus in regno nostro tenendas quantum ad nos pertinet
erga nostros, omnes de regno nostro tam clerici quam laici
observent quantum ad se pertinet erga suos. Quia vero
sigillum nondum habuimus, presentem cartam sigillis venerabilis
patris nostri domini Gualonis tituli Sancti Martini presbiteri
cardinalis, apostolice sedis legati, et Willelmi Marescalli comitis
Penbrok, rectoris nostri et regni nostri, fecimus sigillari.
Testibus prenominatis et aliis multis. Datum per manus predictorum
domini legati et Willelmi Marescalli apud Sanctum
Paulum Londonie, sexto die Novembris, anno regni nostri
secundo.</p>

in Various Collections</cite>, I. 384-5 (Historical Manuscripts Commission, 1901).
Two of these variants have been here adopted (a) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>regem Anglie</i></span>” for
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>regem Anglorum</i></span>” and (b) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>postmodum</i></span>” added after “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pontifice</i></span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The entry for ‘3 Edward I. c. 41’ refers to ‘520 n.’ which appears in ‘<a href='#f1022'>527 n.</a>’</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='c772'></a>The entry for ‘5 Henry IV. c. 14’ in the index of Statutes
refers to ‘<a href='#f772'>425 n.</a>’ That note refers to ‘1 Henry IV. c. 14’, which
is most likely correct. One summary of that Statute says that it “abolished appeals
of treason in parliament, and sent the accuser to established courts of law.”
(Lolme, <cite>The Constitution of England</cite>, 1839, p. 137.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Coincidentally, a reference in the index entry for ‘Constables’ refers to
‘456 n.’ No note on that page mentions that topic. However, the ‘Court
of the Constable and Marshal’ <i>is</i> mentioned in the same ‘425 n.’,
which is not indexed to that topic. We suggest that the reference to
<a href='#f772'>425 n.</a> was intended.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lapses in the punctuation of index and footnote entries have been regularized
with no further mention.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.
Those with a third number refer to the line within a footnote beginning on
that page.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
